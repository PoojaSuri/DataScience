0,MD.HOYER,MD,Hoyer,"Mr. Speaker, it was to my profound disappointment that I learned last night that the House would adjourn the 112th Congress without providing assistance to the victims of Superstorm Sandy.
I am joined today, Mr. Speaker, by many of my colleagues from the jurisdictions whose people received the most damaging blow. Though my district did not sustain the extreme damage that those in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut did, the President declared several Maryland counties eligible for Federal assistance from this storm, but it was minor, and my citizens are not in dire circumstances; but the citizens of some from whom we will hear today are in that condition.
Those counties joined hundreds in the 1,000-mile diameter of this storm--the largest geographically in the history of the Atlantic hurricanes. Now, at best, the Speaker has said that Sandy's victims will need to wait until the next Congress to receive assistance--Wait, they say, to millions who are in pain and in distress. We should not be waiting. We should be voting this very morning, which I tell you, Mr. Speaker, I expect to happen from my discussions with the majority leader.
As I said last night, I went with Congressman Greg Meeks to Breezy Point and the Rockaways in New York, and what I saw there in Sandy's aftermath defied description and demanded action. To those who say that FEMA has not yet disbursed all the funds it has to assist families and businesses, I would tell them that they deeply underestimate the damage in these areas and the wide range of assistance required to alleviate the pain and suffering. At Jacob Riis Park, I saw the mountains of debris that the Corps of Engineers had begun to remove from neighborhoods. That debris represents people's lives, homes, and businesses.
With this legislation, we would have provided up to $1.6 billion to the Corps to continue removing debris so that families could begin rebuilding. Would we have had to borrow that money? Yes. Just as if the furnace went out and the temperature were at zero, you would immediately replace the furnace to keep the families safe and borrow the money to do so; and, yes, we would have had to repay it, and we would.
This bill would have allocated $6 million in emergency aid for food banks to make sure that people in the richest country on the face of the Earth have some sustenance for them and their children. I saw an area of Breezy Point where more than 100 homes were devastated by fire when an electric transformer malfunctioned. The many firefighters who lived in that neighborhood could not get additional help from surrounding boroughs due to the severe flooding. They battled mightily and they saved many lives, but there is little left--indeed, none--of their homes.
I saw local businesses, Mr. Speaker, which had been there for years, completely destroyed, waiting for the $620 million in SBA assistance this bill would have provided. We talked a lot about not imposing burdens on small business by additional taxes. These small businesses are out of business without our help. We walk away today from nearly $4 billion in assistance to help reconstruct Rockaway Beach and other places, which is critical to the area's economic recovery and important to prevent further storm damage.
Finally, there is also the toll on transit and infrastructure, including inundated subway and traffic tunnels that were referred to last night. This bill would have provided up to $10.9 billion for transit and $2.2 billion for highways to help make sure that the area is not just cleared of water but repaired. If small businesses are going to be able to operate, it will be because consumers and customers can get to them and get to the schools and get to the hospitals and get to their families.
Waiting to act until later this month when Members were here and ready to vote last night is not the right choice. No Member of this House could travel to the Northeast, see the damage, and tell anyone in those areas to wait--wait for us to act, wait for us to help, wait for us to come to your aid. We cannot and we should not wait. We must not walk away. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker of this House to reconsider and to act immediately.

1,NJ.RUNYAN,NJ,Runyan,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in disbelief that a Hurricane Sandy disaster relief bill has failed to come to the floor in the current Congress.
It has been over two months since Super Storm Sandy devastated my home state of New Jersey, and Congress has failed to act. After Hurricane Katrina Congress acted and passed a supplemental spending bill within 10 days.
My district was ground zero for Sandy and suffered horrific damage.
I can personally attest to the devastation as I toured many of the coastal towns in the days after the storm, and I can honestly say that some areas look like they had just been bombed.
Governor Christie, after careful examination, estimates the damage to New Jersey alone to be $36.9 billion.
I fully support the Governor's request. New Jersey will need every last dime in order to rebuild successfully.

2,NY.MCCARTHY,NY,McCarthy,"Mr, Speaker, I rise today to express my absolute shock that the House Republican leadership has adjourned the 112th Congress without addressing the needs of the victims of Superstorm Sandy.
Like most Members whose constituents were affected by Sandy, we expected, and were all but assured, that there would be consideration of a supplemental appropriations bill before this House adjourned. It is utterly unacceptable to leave millions of Americans across the most densely populated part of the nation, including my Long Island district, on the hook for the unexpected costs of a natural disaster.
The House Republican leadership had plenty of time to act--let's review the timeline. In November, Governors from affected states acted to give preliminary assessments of the damage caused to their cities and towns. In early December, the President submitted to Speaker Boehner a detailed supplemental package. By the end of December, the Senate passed a bipartisan supplemental providing sixty billion dollars in federal resources to Sandy victims. And yesterday, House Republican leadership chose to give Members an extra day of vacation rather than take up the Senate-passed bill or, at the very least, even attempt to address the needs of millions because of this natural disaster. All the House leadership did was tell storm victims to wait until the next Congress. Excuse me for being cynical, but I don't have much faith that this House leadership can keep its word and deliver for the people in a timely manner. Midnight hour deals on fiscal cliffs, pending dysfunction with the debt ceiling situation in two months--I just don't believe it.
Ladies and gentlemen, this represents an unprecedented action in the Congress. Never before has the United States Congress turned its back on its citizens after a natural disaster. Members of this Congress whose constituents were affected by Sandy have time and time again supported supplemental appropriations bills for other areas of the country affected by natural disaster. We were there with funding after Katrina, and we were there after the floods in the Midwest. Nowwe need to be there for millions in the Northeast. How come when it is our constituents' unfortunate circumstance to be in need of similar funding we are told to wait?
It's shameful.
I am pleased that both my Republican and Democratic colleagues have expressed their shock and disappointment in House leadership for not allowing a vote on a Sandy aid package. I will not rest until I can deliver this funding to my constituents on Long Island and to the millions who live throughout the Northeast. The Senate passed a good bill, a bipartisan bill, a bill that includes much needed mitigation funding as well. Nine weeks is already far too long for folks to wait to be helped by our federal government after a disaster of this magnitude. FEMA alone cannot provide all the necessary funding until this House acts. The Small Business Administration, the Army Corps of Engineers, other vital federal agencies and our state and local governments NEED the additional resources to help stem the hurt Sandy caused.
I am ashamed of the actions of this House Republican leadership and I remain committed to getting Long Islanders and those across the Northeast the federal assistance they deserve.",NY,MCCARTHY,-0.285,D,mr speaker rise today express absolut shock hous republican leadership adjourn 112th congress without address need victim superstorm sandi like member whose constitu affect sandi expect assur would consider supplement appropri bill hous adjourn utterli unaccept leav million american across dens popul part nation includ long island district hook unexpect cost natur disast hous republican leadership plenti time actlet review timelin novemb governor affect state act give preliminari assess damag caus citi town earli decemb presid submit speaker boehner detail supplement packag end decemb senat pass bipartisan supplement provid sixti billion dollar feder resourc sandi victim yesterday hous republican leadership chose give member extra day vacat rather take senatepass bill least even attempt address need million natur disast hous leadership tell storm victim wait next congress excus cynic dont much faith hous leadership keep word deliv peopl time manner midnight hour deal fiscal cliff pend dysfunct debt ceil situat two monthsi dont believ ladi gentlemen repres unpreced action congress never unit state congress turn back citizen natur disast member congress whose constitu affect sandi time time support supplement appropri bill area countri affect natur disast fund katrina flood midwest noww need million northeast come constitu unfortun circumst need similar fund told wait shame pleas republican democrat colleagu express shock disappoint hous leadership allow vote sandi aid packag rest deliv fund constitu long island million live throughout northeast senat pass good bill bipartisan bill bill includ much need mitig fund well nine week alreadi far long folk wait help feder govern disast magnitud fema alon cannot provid necessari fund hous act small busi administr armi corp engin vital feder agenc state local govern need addit resourc help stem hurt sandi caus asham action hous republican leadership remain commit get long island across northeast feder assist deserv
3,NY.GRIMM,NY,Grimm,"Mr. Speaker, it's very difficult to stand here and have to speak to my constituents knowing that we're going to break, we're going to end this Congress, and I'm going to go and walk the streets in Midland Beach, in South Beach, in New Dorp Beach and Tottenville, and I'm going to meet with homeowners that I've been meeting with for 9 weeks now and I can't tell them that everything is going to be okay because, as of right now, everything is not okay. In fact, it's far from okay.
I don't often agree with my colleague that just spoke, Mr. Nadler, on a lot of substantive issues, but I have to agree with him today, and that is not an easy thing for me to do because there was a betrayal. There was an error in judgment that is going to cost, I think, the trust of the American people, not from me individually, not necessarily even for the Members here today, but for this body as a whole as we move forward.
I couldn't be more proud to be an American. You know, I used to tease people that I bleed red, white, and blue. Since I was young, I knew I would serve in the military, and I did. And I would have given my life for this country time and time again. And even later on, I put myself in harm's way serving with one of the greatest organizations this country has to offer with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a huge honor. And I really, really felt, when I took my oath as a Member of Congress, that it would be a level of service that would even outweigh my prior service because I was going to be in a position to help my fellow Americans every way that I could and to actually go out and touch my friends, neighbors, even those that didn't support me or had different political ideologies, I was going to be able to use the work ethic that I inherited from my father to make their life a little better. That's why I took this job, to make people's lives a little better, to make life in the United States a little better. And I'm not able to do that today, and I don't understand why.
And I think it's inexcusable that we did not have this vote and bring those that are suffering, those men and women that are looking at their children right now, and they're not sure what to tell them because they've lost their small business, their only source of income.
And why is that important? Well, because the SBA and FEMA and all the government officials that hit the ground when Superstorm Sandy hit explained that if you didn't get money into the hands of these small businesses almost immediately, then most likely they would go under. If you don't start rebuilding right away, people start to become depressed and they lose hope. Let's not even discuss the economic impact.
So to delay this vote, even for another day, is something that will resonate, not only with the people that have been affected and are suffering and have lost everything, but I think it will resonate with the American people for a long time; and I think it will make them wonder what we are here for and what is the role of the Federal Government, what is the role of the Congress, and maybe most importantly, can they trust us.
So it is with a heartfelt apology that I apologize to my constituents, to my fellow New Yorkers in need, those in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. I did all that I could. I will not stop. I will not relent, and I will continue to push for this vote to come as quickly as possible. But there is no rhyme nor reason, and it is inexcusable that it has not come already.
You are in my thoughts and my prayers, and I will be there on the ground as soon as I get back to New York to help as much as I can, knowing that I'm not helping nearly enough because we don't have the funding to do so.
I want to thank my colleagues across the aisle that have been exemplary. It has been an honor to work so closely with you on these efforts. It has been not only bipartisan but bicameral. Governors, mayors all across the aisles have weighed in, and that is something that I will treasure and will continue to do as we move forward, knowing that we should not have to be here today.",NY,GRIMM,0.359,R,mr speaker difficult stand speak constitu know go break go end congress im go go walk street midland beach south beach new dorp beach tottenvil im go meet homeown ive meet 9 week cant tell everyth go okay right everyth okay fact far okay dont often agre colleagu spoke mr nadler lot substant issu agre today easi thing betray error judgment go cost think trust american peopl individu necessarili even member today bodi whole move forward couldnt proud american know use teas peopl bleed red white blue sinc young knew would serv militari would given life countri time time even later put harm way serv one greatest organ countri offer feder bureau investig huge honor realli realli felt took oath member congress would level servic would even outweigh prior servic go posit help fellow american everi way could actual go touch friend neighbor even didnt support differ polit ideolog go abl use work ethic inherit father make life littl better that took job make peopl live littl better make life unit state littl better im abl today dont understand think inexcus vote bring suffer men women look children right theyr sure tell theyv lost small busi sourc incom import well sba fema govern offici hit ground superstorm sandi hit explain didnt get money hand small busi almost immedi like would go dont start rebuild right away peopl start becom depress lose hope let even discuss econom impact delay vote even anoth day someth reson peopl affect suffer lost everyth think reson american peopl long time think make wonder role feder govern role congress mayb importantli trust us heartfelt apolog apolog constitu fellow new yorker need new jersey connecticut pennsylvania could stop relent continu push vote come quickli possibl rhyme reason inexcus come alreadi thought prayer ground soon get back new york help much know im help nearli enough dont fund want thank colleagu across aisl exemplari honor work close effort bipartisan bicamer governor mayor across aisl weigh someth treasur continu move forward know today
4,NY.NADLER,NY,Nadler,"Mr. Speaker, sometimes events occur that are so out of the ordinary, so unusual as to defy belief. Such is the decision of the Speaker last night not to permit this House to vote on relief aid for the three States and some other areas that were devastated by Hurricane Sandy.
I have been in this House for 20 years. There have been many disasters--floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires. In every single instance, this House has voted aid for the necessary States; in every single instance, usually within a week or 2. Never more than 3. It has now been 9 weeks since October 29 when Hurricane Sandy devastated three States and parts of more--9 weeks.
The Senate passed a bill to aid us. The House was ready. The bill was prepared and an amendment was prepared. We were assured the bill would be on the floor last night or today. At the last minute the Speaker, without even talking to Republicans, not to mention Democrats from New York, refusing to meet with them, suddenly pulled the bill and said we wouldn't have a vote; as if the people in New York and Connecticut and Pennsylvania, New Jersey are not in need of aid; as if thousands of people are still not without heat, without water--as if thousands of small businesses don't need loans and aid so that they don't go under; as if thousands of people don't need help to rebuild their homes, to clear the trash from their properties; as if hundreds of municipalities don't need aid to finance this activity, having used up all their budgets for that purpose.
We're told by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee we'll get a bill on the floor later this month in the next Congress. It's already 9 weeks. It's already an unprecedented length of time. And why? Are New Yorkers and Pennsylvanians and Connecticut residents and New Jersey residents less American than the people that we aid in the Midwest and the South when we vote for aid for those people because they are the victims of natural disasters? How can we treat an entire region of the country this way? It is the most disgraceful action I've seen in this House in the 20 years I've been here.
I see that we're told that, well, FEMA still has money until March. But it's not just FEMA; it's the Small Business Administration that needs the appropriation now to help small businesses now; it's the Army Corps of Engineers that needs the authorization, the appropriation now to help the people who are victimized.
There is no excuse for this, none. It is a betrayal of the people of those States. It is a betrayal of the people of the United States. It is a betrayal by the Speaker personally of the Members of this House not to permit a vote. I have never seen an action like it. I hope I never see it again.
I urge the Speaker to reconsider and to rectify this decision today, because today is the deadline to avert going down in history as shameful.",NY,NADLER,-0.495,D,mr speaker sometim event occur ordinari unusu defi belief decis speaker last night permit hous vote relief aid three state area devast hurrican sandi hous 20 year mani disastersflood hurrican tornado earthquak wildfir everi singl instanc hous vote aid necessari state everi singl instanc usual within week 2 never 3 9 week sinc octob 29 hurrican sandi devast three state part more9 week senat pass bill aid us hous readi bill prepar amend prepar assur bill would floor last night today last minut speaker without even talk republican mention democrat new york refus meet suddenli pull bill said wouldnt vote peopl new york connecticut pennsylvania new jersey need aid thousand peopl still without heat without watera thousand small busi dont need loan aid dont go thousand peopl dont need help rebuild home clear trash properti hundr municip dont need aid financ activ use budget purpos told chairman appropri committe well get bill floor later month next congress alreadi 9 week alreadi unpreced length time new yorker pennsylvanian connecticut resid new jersey resid less american peopl aid midwest south vote aid peopl victim natur disast treat entir region countri way disgrac action ive seen hous 20 year ive see told well fema still money march fema small busi administr need appropri help small busi armi corp engin need author appropri help peopl victim excus none betray peopl state betray peopl unit state betray speaker person member hous permit vote never seen action like hope never see urg speaker reconsid rectifi decis today today deadlin avert go histori shame
5,NY.CROWLEY,NY,Crowley,"Mr. Speaker, last night the Republican leadership reneged on their commitment to vote on aid for the families in the States that were devastated by Superstorm Sandy. We were told it was because Republicans just couldn't stomach any additional votes in this Congress.
I wonder if those same people walked along the beaches of Long Beach and Long Island, Breezy Point and Belle Harbor and Rockaway Beach in Greg Meeks's district, Staten Island or Seaside Heights in New Jersey; if they could stomach the devastation they would witness, stomach the lives that were lost, stomach the homes that have been destroyed or the families that have been displaced, stomach the businesses that are closed and, in many places, have been lost.
In the weeks after the storm, my Republican colleagues told us--not all, by the way, and I want to point out that Mr. Grimm and Mr. King, Mr. Dold and others were very, very helpful--but the leadership, I'm talking about, told us they were with us and that they would support us.
But I guess those were only words, because last night we learned the truth. And thanks to their actions, there's no additional Federal assistance to help hardworking people rebuild and restart their lives.
Now, I'm not a cynic, but I do wonder, what if we told the Republicans that a few millionaires' and billionaires' lives were destroyed by the storm, whether they'd want to help all the families hurting because of Sandy?
And I wonder, what if Republicans were promised that by providing aid to families in need that, in turn, they would get a tax break? Would these incentives have changed their mind? Would it have prompted action? Because it truly does appear their only priority is helping those that have the most.
Republicans in Congress brought this House to a new low last night.
The banner over the Speaker's chair says ``In God We Trust.'' God alone cannot help these families rebuild but, unfortunately, the American people cannot trust the Republican Congress to help either. The only thing my Republican colleagues did this week was to serve up false hope to the people who have been devastated by the storm, false promises, false guarantees that we'd be there to help them in their time of need.
Many of you know that my cousin, John Moran--I don't speak about John often--was killed on 9/11. He came from the Rockaway community. There was a monument on the beach, 118th Street. There were, I would say, dozens of monuments, as Congressman Meeks knows, along the Rockaway Peninsula. They were destroyed by Hurricane Sandy.
It didn't stop my family and his neighbors from going out and sifting through the feet of sand to find that memorial. It was that precious to them. They didn't wait for the Federal Government to come help pull them up by their bootstraps. They did it themselves. They continue to do it.
There are humble people, proud people throughout this entire region who have been affected by this. They will recover but, sad to say, no thanks to the 112th Congress.",NY,CROWLEY,-0.409,D,mr speaker last night republican leadership reneg commit vote aid famili state devast superstorm sandi told republican couldnt stomach addit vote congress wonder peopl walk along beach long beach long island breezi point bell harbor rockaway beach greg meekss district staten island seasid height new jersey could stomach devast would wit stomach live lost stomach home destroy famili displac stomach busi close mani place lost week storm republican colleagu told usnot way want point mr grimm mr king mr dold other helpfulbut leadership im talk told us us would support us guess word last night learn truth thank action there addit feder assist help hardwork peopl rebuild restart live im cynic wonder told republican millionair billionair live destroy storm whether theyd want help famili hurt sandi wonder republican promis provid aid famili need turn would get tax break would incent chang mind would prompt action truli appear prioriti help republican congress brought hous new low last night banner speaker chair say god trust god alon cannot help famili rebuild unfortun american peopl cannot trust republican congress help either thing republican colleagu week serv fals hope peopl devast storm fals promis fals guarante wed help time need mani know cousin john morani dont speak john oftenwa kill 911 came rockaway commun monument beach 118th street would say dozen monument congressman meek know along rockaway peninsula destroy hurrican sandi didnt stop famili neighbor go sift feet sand find memori preciou didnt wait feder govern come help pull bootstrap continu humbl peopl proud peopl throughout entir region affect recov sad say thank 112th congress
6,NY.KING,NY,King,"Thank you, Mr. Speaker. At the outset, let me thank you for your service during your time in Congress, and thank you for your remarks here this morning.
I think it's important to set the record straight. Last night, many of us came to the floor and rightly said that the conduct of the Republican leadership was disgraceful, it was indefensible, and it was immoral. But I think it's important to lay out the facts as to how we reached this situation so we're not put in a position of name-calling or somehow we're angry or feelings are hurt. This goes far beyond any of that.
The fact is, as Congresswoman Lowey said, within 10 days after Katrina, $60 billion was appropriated. That number ended up going well over $100 billion. It's now 9 weeks and nothing has been appropriated by this Congress for the people of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Long Island, which I represent.
The fact is that over the last 5, 6, 7 weeks we did everything that the Republican leadership asked us to do. Governor Cuomo came down. I was at the meeting. He met with the Speaker. Governor Christie came down. He met with the Speaker. Governor Bloomberg came down. He met with the majority leader. We were asked to submit detailed documentation. Governor Christie, Governor Cuomo, and Mayor Bloomberg all submitted absolute documentation. When we asked if anything else is required, they said, No, you've given us all we need.
When the bill came from the Senate, we were told there was some pork in the bill. That was taken out of the bill. The bill that was going to be voted on on the House floor was exactly in compliance with what the Republican leadership asked us to do.
Let me just say at this time, in my dealings with him, Majority Leader Cantor has been very straightforward, very direct. Last night, I know that he was fighting to get the bill on the calendar. It was the Speaker that, for whatever reason, walked off the floor and said that the bill was being pulled.
Now I don't enjoy saying this. I consider myself a personal friend of John Boehner. And John Boehner personally has been very helpful to me over the years. So it pains me to say this. But the fact is the dismissive attitude that was shown last night toward New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, typifies, I believe, a strain in the Republican Party. I know this is not the place to discuss politics, but that politics seeps over into a governmental decision that was made.
I can't imagine that type of indifference, that type of disregard, that cavalier attitude being shown to any other part of the country when we're talking about real life-and-death situations here--and to just have the Speaker walk off and not even tell us. He tells an aide to the majority leader, who then tells us that the item that means life and death was taken off the calendar and is gone for this session.
Now they say it's going to be brought back up in January. The fact is: let's be real. We're not in session next week. The following week we're in session for 2 days. The following week is the inauguration, and we're in recess for 2 days. Then we have the State of the Union. Committees haven't even organized yet. And does anyone believe if they wouldn't vote for a $60.4 billion last night, that the Appropriations Committee is suddenly going to get religion and going to vote the full amount, when we know what their attitude is--that somehow money going to New York and New Jersey and Connecticut is corrupt money, when money going to their States is so honorable. I would just say that these people have no problem finding New York when it comes to raising money. It's only when it comes to allocating money that they can't find the ability to do it.
So I'm standing here on the House floor today saying we have a moral obligation as Republicans, as Democrats, as Americans. I spoke to Governor Christie and Governor Cuomo. We've been in constant contact with Mayor Bloomberg. We cannot believe that this cruel knife in the back was delivered to our region. I have to go home this weekend and next weekend and the week after and see the hundreds and thousands of people who are out of their homes, who don't have shelter, who don't have food, and they're living with relatives, friends, and living in trailers. This is not the United States of America. This should not be the Republican Party. This should not be the Republican leadership.
I'm asking the Speaker, tell Hal Rogers and these people who somehow who have become very sanctimonious when dealing with New York and New Jersey that they have an obligation to do what they have to do--and that's provide the aid and relief that we need. If there's one penny that they have a problem with, let us know. But don't walk out in the dark of night and ignore us.",NY,KING,0.477,R,thank mr speaker outset let thank servic time congress thank remark morn think import set record straight last night mani us came floor rightli said conduct republican leadership disgrac indefens immor think import lay fact reach situat put posit namecal somehow angri feel hurt goe far beyond fact congresswoman lowey said within 10 day katrina 60 billion appropri number end go well 100 billion 9 week noth appropri congress peopl new york new jersey connecticut long island repres fact last 5 6 7 week everyth republican leadership ask us governor cuomo came meet met speaker governor christi came met speaker governor bloomberg came met major leader ask submit detail document governor christi governor cuomo mayor bloomberg submit absolut document ask anyth els requir said youv given us need bill came senat told pork bill taken bill bill go vote hous floor exactli complianc republican leadership ask us let say time deal major leader cantor straightforward direct last night know fight get bill calendar speaker whatev reason walk floor said bill pull dont enjoy say consid person friend john boehner john boehner person help year pain say fact dismiss attitud shown last night toward new york new jersey connecticut typifi believ strain republican parti know place discuss polit polit seep government decis made cant imagin type indiffer type disregard cavali attitud shown part countri talk real lifeanddeath situat hereand speaker walk even tell us tell aid major leader tell us item mean life death taken calendar gone session say go brought back januari fact let real session next week follow week session 2 day follow week inaugur recess 2 day state union committe havent even organ yet anyon believ wouldnt vote 60 4 billion last night appropri committe suddenli go get religion go vote full amount know attitud isthat somehow money go new york new jersey connecticut corrupt money money go state honor would say peopl problem find new york come rais money come alloc money cant find abil im stand hous floor today say moral oblig republican democrat american spoke governor christi governor cuomo weve constant contact mayor bloomberg cannot believ cruel knife back deliv region go home weekend next weekend week see hundr thousand peopl home dont shelter dont food theyr live rel friend live trailer unit state america republican parti republican leadership im ask speaker tell hal roger peopl somehow becom sanctimoni deal new york new jersey oblig doand that provid aid relief need there one penni problem let us know dont walk dark night ignor us
7,NY.LOWEY,NY,Lowey,"Mr. Speaker, the Republican do-nothing leadership has an opportunity to do something--something very important--today to help the more than 17 million Americans who were devastated by Hurricane Sandy, one of the worst storms in U.S. history, more than 9 weeks ago. The Senate has sent us a good bill. We are ready to act. We have the bipartisan votes to pass it. And yet the House Republican leadership has said there will be no votes today, the last day to pass this legislation without delay before we have to start all over again in the new session of Congress tomorrow.
Let me be very clear. Republican leadership has turned their backs on New Yorkers. They have turned their backs on those suffering without homes and businesses struggling just to get by. They have no valid reason for this delay--only the dysfunction with which they lead this body.
This record storm resulted in the deaths of over 100 Americans. The coasts of New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut have been devastated. Other surrounding States have sustained significant damage. In 2005, this body came together and passed a Federal disaster assistance bill to help the gulf recover from Hurricane Katrina 2 weeks after the storm. Congress acted to assist those who suffered damage in Hurricane Gustav and Ike within 1 month.
The Governors of our States, Democrat and Republican, have assessed over $82 billion in damages. The Senate bill would have provided $60.4 billion--not everything that was requested, but a detailed, thoughtful disaster assistance plan to help these communities rebuild. More than 9 weeks since the storm hit, House Republican leadership is doing nothing, after giving us nearly virtual assurance just yesterday that we would consider this assistance bill today.
When a disaster hits on American soil, we as a Congress have the responsibility and tradition of working together, Democrat and Republican, to help communities rebuild. Our citizens are counting on us to help them recover from the storm and mitigate future disasters. I respectfully urge House leadership to reconsider their decision. Support the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Put politics aside. Do the right thing. People are waiting. People need this assistance.

8,NJ.PALLONE,NJ,Pallone,"Let me thank Mr. King, my colleague from New York, for his remarks. I really appreciate what he said--that this is not a Republican or Democratic issue. It shouldn't be politicized. Natural disasters and responding to them are what I've seen over my 25 years in Congress, and they are what bring us together to try to help people. The Speaker should not use this opportunity to tear us apart.
I was here last night when we got the word through Congressman King that the Speaker was going to pull this bill. And what the message said was, Well, we can do this in January. We'll do it sometime later in January in the new Congress.
As Congressman King said, we can't wait. My district was devastated by this storm. I would ask of Speaker Boehner, come to Sea Bright, New Jersey. Drive through Sea Bright, New Jersey. It's a town that has less than 2,000 people. The business district is totally destroyed. One or two stores have reopened; the rest are still closed. Most of the people still have not been able to return to the town.
Go to Union Beach in New Jersey, also in my district, where you can see that now everything is exposed. We still have people that do not have a place to stay, that are looking for an apartment or staying in motels or looking for a trailer to be placed next to their home and still don't have it.
We need to rebuild now. We need to act now. We can't wait for the next Congress or another couple of weeks or another couple of months.
What I don't understand, Mr. Speaker, is how is it possible that this has become a political issue? It is clear that we're here today. We can vote on this. The votes are clearly there. We should have an open debate. That's what democracy is all about. And all of a sudden, because the Tea Party or some conservative element is worried that they have to vote on another spending bill, all of a sudden the Speaker says, well, we can't do this today. This is politicizing a situation that should not be political. It is another example of what I call the ``do-nothing'' Congress.
This Congress did very little. It had fewer bills passed than in anybody's memory. Rather than go out on this negative note about not bringing up an emergency because of a hurricane, a devastating natural disaster, why not do something positive on a bipartisan basis, Mr. Speaker. Bring this up. Let us have an open debate. We're still here. Don't let this Congress die on this negative note. Let it build on a positive note, so when we come in and we're sworn in on Thursday, we can show that we can work on a bipartisan basis.

10,NY.BISHOP,NY,Bishop,"Mr. Speaker, I rise in solidarity with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle against the House Republican leadership's outrageous decision to refuse emergency assistance for our States to recover from the strongest storm to ravage our region in generations.
It's simply unconscionable that this Chamber would walk away from a region desperate for assistance in its greatest hour of need. We cannot accept this shockingly callous indifference of the leadership to the human suffering that our constituents and their fellow citizens continue to endure.
The leadership's decision stands in stark contrast to the immediate decisions to provide relief in the wake of every disaster that has befallen this Nation over the past many years. It comes in stark contrast to our Nation's call to provide well over $100 billion to Louisiana and the Gulf States following that tragedy, the first $62 billion of which was on its way to the Gulf States within 2 weeks of the storm.
More than 2 months after our region was struck, our constituents are still waiting for help. Our States are overextended and our constituents have reached the limits of their tolerance. They deserve more than the Federal Government's refusal to help, particularly after the Senate's strong bipartisan approval of the aid we need.
Our leadership has decided to pass up an important investment against future losses. Many of our districts remain exposed to future damage. My own district, for example, experienced two relatively routine storms in late December, but, nonetheless, those storms compounded the massive erosion along the south shore of Long Island. We simply cannot afford any further breaches, flooding, overwashing, or storm damage without incurring significant losses to our infrastructure and to our economy.
Mr. Speaker, let me close with this:
What do I say when I go home to my constituents in Mastic Beach, a working class community on Moriches Bay with a little over 5,000 homes, about a thousand of which sustained damage, a great many of which are unrepairable? Do I tell them that the Republican leadership of the House considers it entirely appropriate for their tax dollars to be used for recovery and repair in New Orleans, in Tuscaloosa, in Joplin, or anywhere else in this country where a natural disaster has occurred? Or do I tell them that when it's in their hour of need, the Republican leadership has decided to simply walk away? That's precisely the message that the Republican leadership is sending to my constituents.
They deserve better. The residents of all of the States that were ravaged by this storm deserve better. We must bring this bill to a vote immediately.",NY,BISHOP,-0.301,D,mr speaker rise solidar colleagu side aisl hous republican leadership outrag decis refus emerg assist state recov strongest storm ravag region gener simpli unconscion chamber would walk away region desper assist greatest hour need cannot accept shockingli callou indiffer leadership human suffer constitu fellow citizen continu endur leadership decis stand stark contrast immedi decis provid relief wake everi disast befallen nation past mani year come stark contrast nation call provid well 100 billion louisiana gulf state follow tragedi first 62 billion way gulf state within 2 week storm 2 month region struck constitu still wait help state overextend constitu reach limit toler deserv feder govern refus help particularli senat strong bipartisan approv aid need leadership decid pass import invest futur loss mani district remain expos futur damag district exampl experienc two rel routin storm late decemb nonetheless storm compound massiv eros along south shore long island simpli cannot afford breach flood overwash storm damag without incur signific loss infrastructur economi mr speaker let close say go home constitu mastic beach work class commun morich bay littl 5 000 home thousand sustain damag great mani unrepair tell republican leadership hous consid entir appropri tax dollar use recoveri repair new orlean tuscaloosa joplin anywher els countri natur disast occur tell hour need republican leadership decid simpli walk away that precis messag republican leadership send constitu deserv better resid state ravag storm deserv better must bring bill vote immedi
11,NJ.LOBIONDO,NJ,LoBiondo,"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here today. I did not think it was going to be necessary. But the Superstorm Sandy relief bill, I've heard a lot of people talking about it. This isn't about us as Members of Congress. This is about our constituents. Do you have any idea what it's like when someone else's life is ripped from their hands, lives are lost, all personal property is lost, businesses are lost, and the hope of the Federal Government coming in is what is keeping them alive and motivated, and now with no explanation, the rug is pulled out from all of us, but most of all our constituents?
This is a disaster on top of a disaster. We, all of us, I think I speak for all of us, when Katrina hit, 10 days later, $60 billion, $100 billion altogether. Now we have to hear from people in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and Alabama, and, yes, some people from California and the Midwest when they have a disaster and we were there for them that the rules are going to change for us and it is now not an emergency and the Federal Government doesn't have a role in this?
It's absurd, absolutely absurd. We demand nothing less than we have given the rest of the country. An emergency and disaster means emergency and disaster, and that's what we had. Go back and look at the videos. Go back and see how people were devastated. The people of the Northeast had something we have never seen before, and we're expecting the Federal Government to play their role and be there. That's the minimum that's expected.
We worked hard to put together a package in a bipartisan way. People are crying out for bipartisan action. We had this, Republicans and Democrats, shoulder to shoulder, working together, forming a package, giving a little bit here, giving a little bit there, working our other Members, building the votes, promising, anticipating that we would have today the finishing part of this.
I'm convinced we had the votes. I'm convinced we would have moved this forward. And for us in New Jersey, every day that is lost is a bigger disaster. This isn't about people getting a sun tan. This is about jobs and the economy, a $40 billion tourism business that relies on the summer season. Who is going to come and vacation in a community that doesn't have a beach and whose town is devastated that normally comes there? The answer is nobody. So the bigger disaster is going to come in a couple of months from now, and the money into the pipeline is what we needed now. We needed it 5 minutes ago. We needed it 2 weeks ago. We don't need it a month from now. We need the Federal Government to step up so people's lives can be put back together.
We're all hit hard enough with the recession. On top of that, now we have to deal with the anxiety and the failure of Congress to act, to provide what is normally provided. Why all of the sudden are New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, why are we the first States that have to answer to some new rules or some new formula that is going to come out about how we do these things? I don't ever remember a question with Katrina, that that $60 billion was too big a number. I remember that they were showing how people's lives were devastated. Why are our constituents any less important than the constituents of the past who had devastation? All of this is real, and we need to find a way to move forward.
So, yes, there is anger and frustration. That is all rolled into this. We're going to stay united. We're going to work together. We're going to find a way to move this forward. But we need to make this absolutely crystal clear that this is not about people in Congress; this is about constituents whose lives were ruined.

12,NY.RANGEL,NY,Rangel,"I was just asking my friend, Joe Crowley, is there a legislative possibility that we could bring this to the floor. I think everybody has enough compassion for the Speaker after what he's been through with his own party trying to get some bills to the floor to understand that anything, even something this enormous, could have fallen between the cracks. What a great opportunity to say let's try to put these pieces together.
In any event, nobody has said it's impossible to do it; and if it's just a question of pride in terms of party unity, I can't think of anything at this time that would be better served than to have all of America especially thank the Speaker for reconsidering trying to help the lives of tens of thousands of American people.
Once again, I don't know what my chances are going to be getting into Heaven, but the absence of listening to the compassionate support of the religious community is deafening to me. I know their strong position about same-sex marriage and about women controlling their bodies and all of those things. And I say, if you write the book, you have the rules, do what you have to do.
But, my God, when it comes to caring for people, not New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, not just the United States, but all over the world, can't there be some people that have compassion to know that this is what God expects us to do? That's why we say, in God we trust, because we're supposed to take care of fiscal calamities, which we fail, but the compassion is not in the parties, it's in the people. And these people could be your neighbors today and someone else's neighbor tomorrow.
And this great United States, what a great insurance policy to have, to have friends from different communities, different backgrounds to know, as we say in the hood, we got your back. That's what it's all about. People all over the world, when they have a problem, no matter what the political differences are, know that America will have enough compassion to put aside those differences and to send out our men, our women and our firefighters over there, to do what, to help.

13,PA.MURPHY,PA,Murphy,"Mr. Speaker, thank you for your service and your friendship to our country.
I've been watching the media, Mr. Speaker, and hearing a lot of distortion of what happened in the House Chamber yesterday.
Let's recall that on December 31 at midnight, taxes went up for every taxpayer massively, the fiscal cliff. By the end of the evening, the House came together, working with the Senate, and reduced taxes for 99 percent of American taxpayers. We kept taxes lower for dividend income, capital gains. We maintained a higher child tax credit. We helped keep the marriage penalty from hurting families. We did all this in a permanent way. This is a big win. We have a lot of work to do, but that was a big win.
The President also promised that he would work with us to have further cuts in spending. We should hold him to that promise on both sides of the aisle. We have several serious issues to come in this 113th Congress. We have to deal with the debt ceiling, spending cuts, implementation and regulations in the health care law, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government.
It's easy for people to look at any piece of legislation--I actually challenge people to find some piece of legislation here that was perfect. Any major bill has flaws. Even a rose has thorns, as they say. Let's understand that we will see success when we work together, not when we continue to snipe at each other's heels.

President Kennedy said governing is choosing. We are prepared to choose an investment in the recovery of our neighbors and our country.

15,NY.REED,NY,Reed,"I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to join my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I come from a district in New York that was not impacted by Hurricane Sandy, but I come to this floor today to express my frustration and my disappointment in the decision that was made to not bring up the Hurricane Sandy supplemental aid for the people of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut--our fellow citizens, Americans, who have suffered devastating impacts.
Now, I understand what some of the dynamics of this bill are about. I understand that the Senate has put forth a bill that many on my side of the aisle have expressed concern about--pork-type of activity that the Senate continues to engage in with fisheries and Smithsonian funding and things like that that don't really have much to do with Hurricane Sandy. But that's a separate issue that could have been addressed and should be addressed by this body in cleaning up that bill and in getting the aid, getting the resources to the people who are suffering today.
That was the intended plan, that we were going to let the will of the House speak--clean up the bill that the Senate had produced but, most importantly, do what is right for our fellow citizens because there is not a better purpose of the Federal Government, which is for the Federal Government to stand with our citizens when they are suffering the most, especially when they are suffering from a natural disaster such as Hurricane Sandy.
I join with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in, again, asking for our leadership to change the decision that was made to let the clock run out on this Congress and deal with this issue tomorrow. We don't have the luxury of waiting until tomorrow. These people are suffering today.
I talked to my colleagues of the districts that were impacted by this devastating storm, and I have heard the horror stories, and I've heard the stories of suffering of the many millions of people who were impacted in New Jersey and New York outside of my district. I think it is right and it is just and it is proper for us to hear the stories of those individuals and to make sure that we stand with them and take this bill up now rather than kick it to the next Congress.

17,VA.GRIFFITH,VA,Griffith,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a different subject, one that I think we can all be pleased about. I rise in honor of Virginia State Police Trooper Philip Battel, a devoted public servant.
In the early hours of Friday, December 28, 2012, Trooper Battel saved three lives from a burning home. Trooper Battel was actually assisting the Saltville Police and Smyth County deputies in the search for a stolen car, which had been involved in an earlier police chase, when he noticed an orange hue off in the distance. He decided to investigate.
When Trooper Battel reached the area in question, much to his surprise he saw a home completely engulfed in flames. He banged on the door, but there was no answer. He made the selfless decision to enter the burning home and investigate. He began yelling and making noise. His activity in the house awoke the three residents, who had no idea that their home was burning down around them. His actions led to their ultimate escape from the home and from the fire. They're all in good health. Their lives were saved, and the lives of two of their pets were saved.
Trooper Battel's heroic actions and service to the community are to be commended. I am honored to pay tribute to him. Please join me in thanking Trooper Battel for all that he has done for the people of southwest Virginia.

18,CT.DELAURO,CT,DeLauro,"Writing at the time of Katrina, Harvard Professor Michael Ignatieff called the Constitution ``a contract of citizenship'' that promises, first and foremost, protection. That government will help ``citizens to protect their families and possessions from forces beyond their control.''
He writes:
In America, a citizen has a claim of right on the resources of his or her government when they simply cannot help themselves.
When disasters strike, they test whether the contract is respected in a citizen's hour of need. When the levees broke, the contract of American citizenship failed. Mr. Speaker, the levees broke. They broke in Connecticut, in New York, and New Jersey. Government is about helping families recover and rebuild from major disasters like Superstorm Sandy.
In a shocking display of neglect, this House majority decided not to allow a vote on disaster aid funds so desperately needed to recover and repair from this storm. Hurricane Sandy was one of the most severe storms to hit Connecticut in our State's history. All across our region, families' houses were destroyed and lives were upended.
And whether it has been a fire in the West, a tornado in the Midwest, a hurricane in the gulf coast, or a storm in the Northeast, this body acted. We didn't say no. It was a resounding ``yes'' to help because it is the central responsibility of this institution to act on behalf of the American people.
And yet here we are 2 months since Sandy destroyed thousands of homes and businesses, took 100 lives across this Nation. This House majority said ``no'' on a vote for disaster assistance to help millions of people get back on their feet again. The Republican leadership has broken that contract of citizenship.

19,NJ.HOLT,NJ,Holt,"Well, you've heard it. Our constituents' lives were devastated by the Sandy disaster. It has now been about 9 weeks since Hurricane Sandy brought the winds and the tidal surges. In central New Jersey and Connecticut, in New York, people are hurting. Towns have exhausted their emergency funds and exhausted their borrowing capacity. In other disasters, such as the disaster associated with Katrina or with wildfires or with any number of other natural disasters, this body has acted and aid has been provided quickly.
And yet today, the Speaker is going to allow the 112th Congress to adjourn before passing the much-needed disaster relief package. The Senate acted on this bill. The aid package here was well constructed. It was ready. All we needed was a vote. And the delay is significant. It adds significantly to the hurt. It is not an exaggeration to say that lives are on the line. People are living wherever they can. They don't have the shelter. They don't have the businesses. They don't have their lives. And the Speaker just walks away. That compounds the disaster. The delay compounds the disaster.
It has been said: Well, FEMA has some money already in their account that will last for many weeks. But we're not just talking about FEMA, we're talking about HUD. More than a billion dollars, actually billions of housing aid. The Army Corps of Engineers, the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration, the Department of Interior, the Agriculture Department for food and emergency watershed protection, the EPA for safe drinking water--all of this was in this well-constructed package.
Now, it has often been said that the governing principle of the Republican leadership is ``you're on your own.'' That might actually be a conscientious principle if they really believe in their hearts that your Social Security should be privately invested or you should pay for a college without government help. But this, to say you're on your own after a disaster is inconsiderate. It breaks our trust. It violates an understanding, and it hurts people.",NJ,HOLT,-0.526,D,well youv heard constitu live devast sandi disast 9 week sinc hurrican sandi brought wind tidal surg central new jersey connecticut new york peopl hurt town exhaust emerg fund exhaust borrow capac disast disast associ katrina wildfir number natur disast bodi act aid provid quickli yet today speaker go allow 112th congress adjourn pass muchneed disast relief packag senat act bill aid packag well construct readi need vote delay signific add significantli hurt exagger say live line peopl live wherev dont shelter dont busi dont live speaker walk away compound disast delay compound disast said well fema money alreadi account last mani week talk fema talk hud billion dollar actual billion hous aid armi corp engin nation ocean atmospher administr depart interior agricultur depart food emerg watersh protect epa safe drink wateral wellconstruct packag often said govern principl republican leadership your might actual conscienti principl realli believ heart social secur privat invest pay colleg without govern help say your disast inconsider break trust violat understand hurt peopl
20,NJ.SMITH,NJ,Smith,"Mr. Speaker, the two-tiered amendment disaster relief bill that we had hoped to bring to the floor to get us to the $60 billion that is desperately needed to assist families, businesses, and municipalities devastated by Superstorm Sandy. Our appeal--and it's a bipartisan appeal--is that there is still time to bring this vital legislation to the floor for a vote back to the Senate and then down to the President for signature.
Numerous towns in my district, Mr. Speaker, as well as well as our friends in New York and further north, are still coping with and recovering from the most destructive storm ever in our region--and perhaps the second or third most costly in all of American history.
Today, families lack housing. Businesses are in shambles, and municipalities have been decimated.
In New Jersey, some 346,000 housing units were damaged or destroyed, with 22,000 units rendered absolutely uninhabitable.
An estimated 11,000 housing choice vouchers will be needed to ensure that residents at least have a roof over their heads this winter.
Approximately 100,000 new storm-related unemployment claims have been filed in New Jersey, 100,000, attributable to the storm.
Over 235,000 people in New Jersey have already registered with FEMA for individual assistance.
Seventy-five percent of New Jersey's small businesses were adversely affected, 10 percent of which, or nearly 19,000 businesses, sustained damage of $250,000 or more, far in excess of the loss to businesses from Katrina. Total business losses are estimated to be a whopping $8.3 billion.
Furthermore, an estimated 10,000 structures statewide will need to be demolished, and 1,000 sites across New Jersey will require remediation after hazardous materials discharge.
Fifty-one schools sustained serious damage, including six that will not reopen this school year.
Transit, roads, and bridges have been damaged to the tune of $2.9 billion, which includes 294 damaged railcars and 75 damaged locomotives.
One of the main roads that runs through my district, Route 35, will require an estimated $120 million to repair.
Power and gas lines are expected to cost roughly $1 billion, understandably, given that, at the peak, power outages left 2.4 million people in the dark.
Waste and water and sewer will require about $3 billion to repair and to protect.
Hospitals, assisted living, and other health facilities will have seen over $150 million worth of storm damage. These facts--and there are many more--underscore the devastation unleashed by Sandy, and it is without precedent.
I would say to my colleagues that no recovery is ever accomplished in a single year, but it's about predictability and the certainty of funds to rebuild and to restore that ensures that the work proceeds immediately, comprehensively, efficaciously, and without interruption.
Mr. Speaker, for days and weeks, like many of my colleagues, after that horrible storm hit, I met with hundreds, even thousands of tenacious women and men who, despite crippling losses, were determined to rebuild.
I'll never forget one resident in Belmar who came up to me the day after Superstorm Sandy, and said, I've lost everything, but at least I'm alive.
We need to now backstop these individuals. We need to ensure that the monies are there, that they flow quickly but prudently to ensure that they can rebuild, and their homes and businesses and community.
You know, Congress assisted those pummeled by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 with $62 billion in a mere 2 weeks. We are now past 2 months. And we need to be clear: The President didn't send to Sandy Relief package to Congress December 7. There was a loss of several weeks, but we do have a proposal. It's about 25 percent less than what the affected States have said they needed. New Jersey, New York and the other estimates about $80 billion. It's down at approximately $60 billion, so it is less.
And I've seen and gone through the numbers that my State has sent to Congress as well as to the President. They are very well vetted.
Governor Chris Christie used to be a U.S. attorney. Many of the people around him are former prosecutors. Their tough and disciplined. They hate waste, fraud, and abuse, and they're trying to ensure that the money is there in the amounts needed to make a difference in the lives of your constituents.
Finally, let me just say, Mr. Speaker, we need to act now. As my colleague before me said a moment ago, New Jersey especially as well as New York, are contributing States not takers. We get back far less from the Federal Government than we pay in every year. That's a good thing. We have very, very good businesses that really provide employment for our people.
But we've been devastated, and I would hope and urge the Speaker to bring the Sandy Relief bill to the floor as quickly as possible, hopefully today, tomorrow, but as quickly as possible, because the people who have suffered, the victims, deserve no less.",NJ,SMITH,0.413,R,mr speaker twotier amend disast relief bill hope bring floor get us 60 billion desper need assist famili busi municip devast superstorm sandi appealand bipartisan appeali still time bring vital legisl floor vote back senat presid signatur numer town district mr speaker well well friend new york north still cope recov destruct storm ever regionand perhap second third costli american histori today famili lack hous busi shambl municip decim new jersey 346 000 hous unit damag destroy 22 000 unit render absolut uninhabit estim 11 000 hous choic voucher need ensur resid least roof head winter approxim 100 000 new stormrel unemploy claim file new jersey 100 000 attribut storm 235 000 peopl new jersey alreadi regist fema individu assist seventyf percent new jersey small busi advers affect 10 percent nearli 19 000 busi sustain damag 250 000 far excess loss busi katrina total busi loss estim whop 8 3 billion furthermor estim 10 000 structur statewid need demolish 1 000 site across new jersey requir remedi hazard materi discharg fiftyon school sustain seriou damag includ six reopen school year transit road bridg damag tune 2 9 billion includ 294 damag railcar 75 damag locomot one main road run district rout 35 requir estim 120 million repair power ga line expect cost roughli 1 billion understand given peak power outag left 2 4 million peopl dark wast water sewer requir 3 billion repair protect hospit assist live health facil seen 150 million worth storm damag factsand mani moreunderscor devast unleash sandi without preced would say colleagu recoveri ever accomplish singl year predict certainti fund rebuild restor ensur work proce immedi comprehens efficaci without interrupt mr speaker day week like mani colleagu horribl storm hit met hundr even thousand tenaci women men despit crippl loss determin rebuild ill never forget one resid belmar came day superstorm sandi said ive lost everyth least im aliv need backstop individu need ensur moni flow quickli prudent ensur rebuild home busi commun know congress assist pummel hurrican katrina 2005 62 billion mere 2 week past 2 month need clear presid didnt send sandi relief packag congress decemb 7 loss sever week propos 25 percent less affect state said need new jersey new york estim 80 billion approxim 60 billion less ive seen gone number state sent congress well presid well vet governor chri christi use u attorney mani peopl around former prosecutor tough disciplin hate wast fraud abus theyr tri ensur money amount need make differ live constitu final let say mr speaker need act colleagu said moment ago new jersey especi well new york contribut state taker get back far less feder govern pay everi year that good thing good busi realli provid employ peopl weve devast would hope urg speaker bring sandi relief bill floor quickli possibl hope today tomorrow quickli possibl peopl suffer victim deserv less
21,SC.WILSON,SC,Wilson,"Mr. Speaker, last night, House Speaker John Boehner released a statement outlining his many objectives for the new year, stating:
Now the focus turns to spending. The American people reelected a Republican majority in the House, and we will use that in 2013 to hold the President accountable for the `balanced' approach he promised, meaning significant spending cuts and reforms to the entitlement programs that are driving our country deeper and deeper into debt.
Our national debt has grown to an outrageous $16 trillion. This not only endangers our national security, but senior citizens are threatened with devalued dollars and it also places our children, grandchildren, and future generations at risk of higher taxes with little to no access to the entitlement programs to which they have faithfully contributed. House Republicans understand and are dedicated to resolving our Nation's debt crisis over the next year by reforming our Tax Code, preserving and protecting our entitlement programs, and controlling our spending.
Congratulations to Coach Steve Spurrier, President Harris Pastides and his wonderful wife, Patricia Pastides, and the USC Gamecocks, as well as Coach Dabo Swinney and President Jim Barker and his dedicated wife, Marcia Barker, and the Clemson Tigers for extraordinary Bowl victories.

22,CA.PELOSI,CA,Pelosi,"Mr. Speaker, here we are again today in wonder over the decision that we think has been made by the Republican leadership in the House not to bring legislation to the floor that addresses the needs of those affected by Sandy.
Here's the thing: Everyone who heard about this since last night, when so many Members from the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, other delegations came to the floor to speak about this, said, Don't tell me that. Don't tell me that. Don't tell me that, even though everyone has seen very clearly the devastating damage that was caused by Sandy and the need for people to have assistance, the House would not take up the bill.
Don't tell me that, even though the Senate passed a very strong bill addressing the well-documented needs of the people of the affected region, the House is not taking up the bill.
Don't tell me that, although the region, the leadership, the Governor of New York, Governor Cuomo; the Governor of New Jersey, Governor Christie; the Governor of Connecticut, Governor Malloy; the Mayor of New York, Mayor Bloomberg; and others have immediately addressed the needs to the extent possible by them in their areas and have documented the needs very carefully as to what Federal participation was needed, don't tell me that the House of Representatives is going to ignore that.
Mr. Speaker, much has been said about the need for more civility in politics and in government, and that civility perhaps relates to how we speak to each other and how we curb our enthusiasm about issues we care a great deal about and question, perhaps, motivation of others.
But the real civility that people expect is how this Congress treats them and treats their needs. And never is that tested more clearly than in time of a natural disaster, because that's when people feel the most helpless. That's the time when they see whether the government is there for them or not. That is the time where--they're not going to be made whole, most of these people. Hopefully, what they replace will be a good substitute, and maybe it can open a door to something new for them.
But by and large, it's a long road back. But that first few steps of it, the emergency relief that was provided by the localities and now needs to be compensated for, the next stage of recovery is so essential to the character of a community.
As Mr. Tonko said after the storms last year, it affected the character of the communities in his district, and that was 2011. Here we are at the end of 2012, having some of the same regions hit again by nature with the suddenness and the severity and the power of water and, in some places, fire, and just earth-shattering earth, wind, fire in terms of how it affects people.
So as I said last night, nature pulled the rug out from under people, literally and figuratively, in their communities and in their homes, in their schools and in their workplace, and then are we to say to them, Now Congress is going to pull the rug out from under you in terms of your hopes and expectations of meeting the needs?
Don't tell me that. We can't tell our constituents that. That would not rise to the level of civility for us to turn our backs and ignore their needs. It's just plain wrong.
So I'm hopeful that perhaps those making this decision have not been affected by--almost everyplace, whether we're talking about Katrina or California, with earthquakes, drought, flood, fire, you name it, we get it all. With the Northeast being hit, once, twice, within 2011 and 2012, with Missouri, with Iowa--I visited Iowa and saw the effect of the floods there. It was devastating. It's really hard, unless you see it, to understand the impact that it has.
The most compelling reason is the look in the eyes of people who ask, What are we going to do to help? How can we help them? And what is our answer? We're just too busy. It's not a priority.
That's just not civil.
So let's honor our responsibility, which is, again, the place where people place their trust. They ignore government. They don't like government. They don't want this; they don't want that. But in times like this, in time of emergency, is really when we prove our worth.
Let's prove our worth and urge the Speaker to bring this legislation to the floor and quickly deal with it while the Senate is still there, it can be sent to the President for his signature, and hope can flow from here, instead of a sense of wonderment, of ``Don't tell me that.'' Let us be able to tell people we feel their pain. We know what they're going through. We can never really know, but we can certainly appreciate their interest in our doing what is right for them.
So, again, I hope and pray. Because we pray for these people. We pray for them all the time. They're in our prayers. Some have lost loved ones. We pray for them. How much prayer would it take for this Congress to find it in their hearts and in their heads to do the right thing? Let's pray that we don't have to tell them that we weren't there for them.",CA,PELOSI,-0.393,D,mr speaker today wonder decis think made republican leadership hous bring legisl floor address need affect sandi here thing everyon heard sinc last night mani member new york new jersey connecticut pennsylvania deleg came floor speak said dont tell dont tell dont tell even though everyon seen clearli devast damag caus sandi need peopl assist hous would take bill dont tell even though senat pass strong bill address welldocu need peopl affect region hous take bill dont tell although region leadership governor new york governor cuomo governor new jersey governor christi governor connecticut governor malloy mayor new york mayor bloomberg other immedi address need extent possibl area document need care feder particip need dont tell hous repres go ignor mr speaker much said need civil polit govern civil perhap relat speak curb enthusiasm issu care great deal question perhap motiv other real civil peopl expect congress treat treat need never test clearli time natur disast that peopl feel helpless that time see whether govern time wheretheyr go made whole peopl hope replac good substitut mayb open door someth new larg long road back first step emerg relief provid local need compens next stage recoveri essenti charact commun mr tonko said storm last year affect charact commun district 2011 end 2012 region hit natur sudden sever power water place fire earthshatt earth wind fire term affect peopl said last night natur pull rug peopl liter figur commun home school workplac say congress go pull rug term hope expect meet need dont tell cant tell constitu would rise level civil us turn back ignor need plain wrong im hope perhap make decis affect byalmost everyplac whether talk katrina california earthquak drought flood fire name get northeast hit twice within 2011 2012 missouri iowai visit iowa saw effect flood devast realli hard unless see understand impact compel reason look eye peopl ask go help help answer busi prioriti that civil let honor respons place peopl place trust ignor govern dont like govern dont want dont want time like time emerg realli prove worth let prove worth urg speaker bring legisl floor quickli deal senat still sent presid signatur hope flow instead sens wonder dont tell let us abl tell peopl feel pain know theyr go never realli know certainli appreci interest right hope pray pray peopl pray time theyr prayer lost love one pray much prayer would take congress find heart head right thing let pray dont tell werent
23,CT.COURTNEY,CT,Courtney,"When Hurricane Sandy struck on October 29 in eastern Connecticut's Long Island Sound with 90-mile-per-hour winds and high tide, it created a path of destruction never seen before. Homes were wiped out, utility infrastructure was wiped out, transportation infrastructure was wiped out. But what was so inspiring about it was that the first responders acted--police, fire, Coast Guard, the Governor of Connecticut, local and municipal officials. They acted. In the weeks since then, the Senate has acted. President Obama declared an emergency on October 30. The Department of Homeland Security acted. The only place that hasn't acted is the House of Representatives, where last night, in the dark of the night, the Speaker announced that he was abandoning the people of northeastern America and allowing the Hurricane Sandy relief bill to die.
That is unacceptable. The people who acted--the first responders, the caregivers, the local officials--they deserve better.

24,TX.POE,TX,Poe,"Mr. Speaker, in 1985, 13-year-old Lavinia Masters went to sleep in her bedroom, which should be the safest place on Earth for children. But a few hours later, she was woken up by an outlaw who sexually assaulted her and put a knife to her throat. She went to the hospital. DNA evidence was taken from her. She did everything she was supposed to do. But that evidence sat, untested, on a dusty crime lab shelf for 20 years while the perpetrator ran loose somewhere in Texas. When the kit was finally tested, police discovered that Kevin Turner had committed this crime. Justice could not occur for Lavinia because the statute of limitations had run.
Mr. Speaker, Lavinia is not alone. There are 400,000 untested rape kits with DNA evidence in the United States. That's why I have introduced, along with Congresswoman Maloney of New York, the SAFER Act. And we can pass it today by unanimous consent. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation.

28,NY.TONKO,NY,Tonko,"Just yesterday, Americans celebrated New Year's Day. They ushered in 2013. As we rang in the new year, the usual message of hope that accompanies the new year--any new year--rang hollow for millions of Americans because of actions taken at the close of that New Year's Day here late last night. People were met with the devastating news that we were not going to take up a measure that would respond to Superstorm Sandy.
And so I rise today to ask the leadership of this House, the people's House, to respond accordingly to the needs of people. I make this request not through some political calculus but rather through the lens of caring and concern and compassion, which ought to be the hallmark of this great institution. We ought not forget that the role that we play here calls upon our moral responsibility to engage our actions and our compassion and empathy for the people we represent or perhaps do not represent directly. Because we, I believe, need to relate to that measurement of compassion to family, friends, neighbors and yes, at times, total strangers.
I make this request sensitized by a situation in my district, the 21st Congressional District at the time, in upstate New York, just about a year-plus before the devastation of Sandy. The torturous treatment of Mother Nature through Irene and Lee on that congressional district, my congressional district, stole lives, wiped away livestock, flooded homes, tore away the hopes and dreams of individuals, and found people abandoned, having lost everything for which they ever worked. And I witnessed how people responded to that tragedy. They picked up and mustered the strength. But they required government to be their partner at that very dark moment in their lives. Having witnessed that pain, having visited communities and having talked with the people, shared tears with the people, I understand that now this situation, in a much more densely populated area of our State, and in neighboring States, requires our assistance, immediate assistance, to respond with compassion.

36,IL.DURBIN,IL,Durbin,"Mr. President, the State of Nevada was admitted to the Union in 1864. Since 1864 there have been 25 Senators in its 148-year history. Today Harry Mason Reid becomes the longest serving Member of Congress in the history of the State of Nevada.
Senator Reid was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives the same year I was elected, 1982, and became a Member of the House in 1983. He became a Member of the Senate in 1987. He has served with great distinction in both Houses of Congress, serving his State of Nevada, and today is the highest ranking Democrat in the Senate, serving as its majority leader.
I daresay, Mr. President, that you and I would probably not really know anything about the town of Searchlight, NV, were it not for Harry Reid. Harry Reid has told us so many stories of his youth and his background in that tiny town and what brought him to this station in life today. I almost feel that if there were a town or high school reunion, I could attend it with Harry and look around and recognize a lot of people there because I have certainly heard a lot of stories about his youth and the people who have had a dramatic impact on his life from the time he was growing up in Searchlight, NV.
We know he came from modest circumstances. His family raised him in a very small home without indoor plumbing. He attended a two-room elementary school in Searchlight, NV. As a child, Senator Reid's father was a hard rock miner and his mother took in laundry. He says of his parents that his father gave him quiet and his mother gave him confidence.
Opportunities were scarce in Searchlight, but Harry made the most of what he had. His book ``The Good Fight'' has a great opening paragraph that I would like to share with everyone because it says so much about what life must have been like in the town of Searchlight.
Harry wrote in his book:
I come from a mining town. But by the time I came along-- December 22, 1939--the leading industry in my hometown of Searchlight, NV, was no longer mining, it was prostitution. I don't exaggerate. There was a local law that said you could not have a house of prostitution or a place that served alcohol within so many feet of a school. Once, when it was determined that one of the clubs was in violation of the law, they moved the school.
It says a lot about Searchlight. It also says a lot about the circumstances he faced growing up. He made the most of what he had.
Between hitchhiking more than 40 miles and staying with extended relatives, Harry was able to attend Basic High School, the nearest high school to Searchlight. While at Basic High in Henderson, he met two people who dramatically changed his life--Landra Gould, who would become his wife of 53 years and counting, and Mike O'Callaghan, who was a coach, a teacher, a mentor, and a friend. Harry Reid said of Mike O'Callaghan that he was the toughest man he ever met.
Harry Reid played high school baseball with Rey Martinez, who would become his chief of staff, and Donnie Wilson, who would also go to work for Reid in Washington.
I once invited ``Mr. Cub,'' Ernie Banks, to my office, and I invited Harry Reid--a former baseball player in his youth--to come up and meet Ernie Banks.
Ernie Banks looked in his eye and said: What position did you play, Harry?
Harry said: I played catcher. 
Ernie Banks said: I don't believe it. Get in the position.
At that point, I heard the bones creaking as Harry went down in the catcher's crouch in my office in front of Ernie Banks, and we all cheered.
He won his first election in high school when he ran for junior class treasurer. Of course he would win because Landra, his wife-to-be, wrote his speech and got him elected. Rey Martinez managed his campaign when he became the senior class president.
He also ran into the fellow I mentioned earlier, Mike O'Callaghan, who had such a profound impact on his personal and political life. Behind Harry's desk, he has a picture of his friend and mentor Governor O'Callaghan.
Harry Reid also took up boxing after he was inspired by Mike O'Callaghan--as I said, the toughest man he ever met, in Harry's memory.
In his book ``The Good Fight,'' Harry said:
There are sluggers, and then there are boxers. I became a pretty good boxer. I could assess situations well, and I learned to recognize and exploit an opposing fighter's weaknesses. I could hit hard, and I could take a punch.
Mr. President, you and I know that is a perfect background for the business we are in today.
With scholarship money Mike O'Callaghan had helped put together for him, Harry Reid left for the College of Southern Utah in Cedar City. He hated being so far away from Landra, so he moved back to Henderson for the summer.
Despite the best efforts of Landra's father to discourage him, Harry married Landra. They eloped in September of 1959. The newly married couple moved to Logan, UT, where he would finish college while renting from a loving Mormon family, Matthew and Louise Bird. Harry Reid and Landra decided to join the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints based on this wonderful family who served as their landlords. He told me many times that he didn't come from a religious family. In his book, he said that the only family religion he remembered was their devotion and love for Franklin Delano Roosevelt in his house.
Mike O'Callaghan left teaching high school for Democratic politics at that point, and he urged Harry to move to Washington, DC, to attend law school. Harry Reid put himself through law school by working nights as a U.S. Capitol police officer. In his book are pictures of Harry in uniform as a Capitol police officer--a job that O'Callaghan had helped line up for him--when he was a law student.
He returned to Nevada after law school and served as Henderson city attorney before being elected to the Nevada Assembly in 1968.
In 1970, at age 30, Harry Reid ran for Lieutenant Governor of Nevada, with his friend and mentor Mike O'Callaghan running for Governor. They won the race, and Harry Reid served as Lieutenant Governor from 1971 until 1974, becoming a friend to my mentor Paul Simon, who was then Lieutenant Governor of Illinois.
Harry lost his race for the U.S. Senate in 1974 when the seat was vacated by Alan Bible, but he lost by fewer than 600 votes. Governor O'Callaghan then asked him to serve as chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission.
When Nevada's population growth led to an additional seat in Congress in 1982, Harry Reid ran for the new seat and won, and that is when I first met him. He served two terms in the House from 1983 to 1987 before running for the Senate. In 1986 Reid won the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat of retiring two-term incumbent Republican Senator Paul Laxalt.
From 1999 to 2005 Harry Reid served as Senate Democratic whip, as minority whip from 1999 to 2001 and again 2003 to 2005, and then as majority whip from 2001 to 2003. During those years as whip, Harry Reid lived on the floor of the Senate. He developed a real understanding not just of the rules and procedures of the Senate but of the institution and the Members.
Mike O'Callaghan died of a heart attack while attending daily Catholic mass in 2004, so he didn't live to see his good friend elected as minority leader in 2005 or, obviously, as majority leader in the Senate. But I know that every single day Harry serves in public life, Mike O'Callaghan is in his heart.
I listened this morning to some of the analysts about what just happened with this historic vote yesterday in the Senate. Some of them this morning, who know a little bit about what really happens here, were diminishing the role played by Harry Reid. I can tell everyone that on the day leading up to the vote, the last day, December 31, I spent the better part of 16 hours in Harry's office as the negotiations went back and forth. There were three parties to that negotiation: Senator McConnell, the President of the United States, and Harry Reid. There was not a minute that passed that e-mails were not transferred back and forth to put together the coalition that passed this historic measure and avoided the economic disaster that otherwise would have occurred. It was not the first time I have seen Harry in that position--behind closed doors, without a lot of fanfare, playing a critical role in the passage of legislation that really makes a difference for the average working families of America.
A few years ago I worked with him as he led the effort to pass the Health Care Reform Act, a measure on which I believe he shares my thinking--it is one of the most important pieces of legislation we have ever worked on in our lives. It never, ever would have become law if it were not for his skill, determination, and the trust the Democratic majority had in their leader, Harry Reid.
This is a day, of course, in Nevada history as much as American history as Harry becomes the longest serving Congressman and Senator in the State of Nevada.
I recall one particular visit to his office. I dropped in frequently there to see what was going on and to chat with him about the business of the Senate and life itself. When I came in, I saw a young rock group called the Killers sitting in his office. Yes, that is their name, the Killers, and they are from Nevada. Harry told me this young group, popular as they are in other places, was especially popular in Nevada because they performed the Nevada State song, which is entitled ``Home Means Nevada.'' When I think about this historic moment today when Harry becomes part of the history of his State, I recall one stanza from that song. It says, ``Deep in the heart of the golden west, home means Nevada to me.'' In all of my conversations over all the years, time and again the conversations always return to his home State of Nevada, his hometown of Searchlight, and the people he loves so much to represent in the Senate.
It has been an honor to serve with this great man. I am glad he achieved this great moment in history on behalf of Nevada and the United States.",IL,DURBIN,-0.496,D,mr presid state nevada admit union 1864 sinc 1864 25 senat 148year histori today harri

37,NV.REID,NV,Reid,"No one would believe this, but I did not know Senator Durbin was going to say a word. Most of what he said is unimportant, but I appreciate his efforts to try to make me better than what I am. I really do appreciate his friendship.
We came as a couple of anxious people to the House of Representatives 30 years ago. Speaking for both of us--and I can do that--it was such a wonderful experience. During the first 3 or 4 months I was in the House of Representatives, I kept thinking I was going to have to pay somebody because I was having such a good time. It took me a while to figure out that the taxpayers were paying me for doing a job that was so much fun.
I appreciate very much Senator Durbin's friendship. I so admire and appreciate him for all he has done for me, the State of Illinois, and the country. He is absolutely right about this--he had a mentor by the name of Paul Simon who had the good fortune to serve, as we were both Lieutenant Governors at or near the same time. We served in the House of Representatives together and we served in the Senate together. What a wonderful human being. Senator Durbin and I have talked about this. Senator Simon was to Dick Durbin what Mike O'Callaghan was to me. He was not only the toughest man I ever knew but the most honest. When he would drive, he would never, ever exceed a posted speed limit. He is somebody whom I will always remember. I could never be like him.
In addition to being tough and honest, he could swear like no one we have ever heard, but only he could do it, this massive man who had almost 200 amateur fights before going to Korea and losing his leg. He was such an exemplary person in my life. So I appreciate Senator Durbin mentioning him. But to me, he was like this great man Paul Simon. I don't know how many books he ended up writing. I am sure it is 15 or 20. He never went to college. He was a brilliant man. So I thank Senator Durbin very much.

It is only in recent times that I find myself presiding as often as I have because of other circumstances, and I am glad I was here to open the Senate today to hear the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois speak about the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada. We first met when he was running for the Senate seat at a campaign event in another State. We worked together at that time and became friends, and from that day on we have actually spoken many times with our wives about that meeting in Florida.
I consider it a privilege that I was on the floor today to hear the words of the Senator from Illinois and I join in praising my friend from Nevada. He is a dear and wonderful friend.

40,NV.REID,NV,Reid,"Mr. President, I am stunned by what didn't happen in the House of Representatives last night. I appreciate that they, with the support of all but a handful of Democrats and just a handful of Republicans, passed something to keep us from going over the fiscal cliff, and that is admirable. Nancy Pelosi deserves such accolades for carrying more than her share of the weight over there in passing this bill. But one of the things they didn't do last night--I wish to read into the Record a letter, an e-mail, from a person by the name of Barrie Kolstein, K-O-L-S-T-E-I-N:
Owner of perhaps the oldest and one of the most recognized violinmaking shops in the United States, located in Baldwin, New York. Shop was severely damaged by recent hurricane Sandy. Owned buildings and occupied them for over 32 years without any problems at all. This storm compromised my building inside and outside, with facilities within the building backing up, pipe breakage and roof damage, plus the horrid conditions that literally assaulted all the buildings in my immediate area. Storm decimated my building as well as the neighboring buildings that perhaps was one of the more stable and viable business areas of Baldwin. My shop has been closed since the storm. We are doing our best to afford the restoration of the building and repair the numerous fine old pedigree string instruments (violins, violas, cellos and basses) that were so horribly damaged. We lost machinery, tools, supplies and most of our filed records. This is a true nightmare, that at the age of 63, I never thought I would be faced with.
There are tens of thousands of people in New York, tens of thousands of people in New Jersey, and other parts of the Northeast who have had their lives turned upside down. I am dismayed and saddened that the House of Representatives walked away last night--didn't even touch this--after we spent so much time here on the floor doing something to help a beleaguered part of our country. I was happy to help with Katrina. I was happy to help with the violent storm that hit Joplin, MO. We all were. We moved in quickly.
It has been months now and these people are still suffering. Governor Cuomo and Governor Christie have done their best with the limited resources that are available when a disaster such as this occurs. This is known in the law as an act of God. No one knew it was coming. No one had any idea this terrible storm would do the damage it did. It was the perfect storm because we had different elements working against each other to create this terrible situation.
So, I repeat, I am dismayed and saddened the House of Representatives adjourned last night without addressing the pressing needs of these people. There are still hundreds of thousands of people who don't have a place to live, whose homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed, as I have indicated from Mr. Kolstein, by this terrible disaster. It is heartbreaking to leave these victims of Sandy stranded and waiting for help.
This storm damaged or destroyed more than 700,000 homes in New York and New Jersey and New England. We have the power to help our countrymen put their lives back together. We did it here in the Senate. We sent it to the House of Representatives, but they walked away, just as they did with postal reform and just as they did with agricultural reform, our farm bill, and just as they have walked away from so many different things this year. They left these people without help. They are gone; they have left; they are not in Washington. I am disappointed we have turned our backs--and I don't include myself in this operation, or anyone in this Senate; we worked on a bipartisan basis to get this done, but I am deeply disappointed the House of Representatives has turned their backs on people who are suffering.
Please understand, everybody, this does not include the leadership of Leader Pelosi or Leader Hoyer. They have done their best to gather their troops to help at any time for anything that is needed.
To walk away from these people is not who we should be as Americans. Wintertime is now here. When disaster strikes, be it fire, flood, storm, or earthquake, we in the past haven't paused and we don't delay, but we have here. As Americans, we respond with haste at a national level when American lives are at stake and American communities are shattered. It is no wonder how people feel about Congress: They just left town.
They need to do better over there. We should have a postal reform bill. We should have a farm bill. The farm bill, by the way, saves $24 billion--not million but billion. Debbie Stabenow, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, worked so hard to get this done. We had a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate overwhelmingly. Why did the House of Representatives drop it? Well, they dropped it because the same porkbarrel programs that help people who don't need help in that farm program were taken out of the bill. So now we are on a short-term extension. The benefits these people don't deserve they are still getting.
They need to do better over there. Compromise is hard; we know that. Sometimes compromise doesn't happen when we want it. Compromise sometimes doesn't satisfy either side. But as I have said here and other places, when I practiced law, we had the concept it was a good settlement when both sides walked out unhappy, having reached a settlement, and that is what we did here the night before last. Actually, it was yesterday, because it was well after midnight. It was a piece of legislation we weren't all elated about, but it moved the ball forward.
We have so many more hard decisions to make in the year ahead. So unlike others behind us in this Capitol, I am not going to stoop to name-calling; I just want people to work and do what they need to do. Let the House of Representatives work its will. Let Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives debate. They have an easier time of it because they can set rules on how to debate. They have the Rules Committee where they can set how long they debate and on what subjects, but let the body work its will, which hasn't happened.
It is a sad day when we turn our backs on millions of our fellow Americans during their time of greatest need, and that certainly is what has happened here.",NV,REID,-0.428,D,mr presid stun didnt happen hous repres last night appreci support hand democrat hand republican pass someth keep us go fiscal cliff admir nanci pelosi deserv accolad carri share weight pass bill one thing didnt last nighti wish read record letter email person name barri kolstein kolstein owner perhap oldest one recogn violinmak shop unit state locat baldwin new york shop sever damag recent hurrican sandi own build occupi 32 year without problem storm compromis build insid outsid facil within build back pipe breakag roof damag plu horrid condit liter assault build immedi area storm decim build well neighbor build perhap one stabl viabl busi area baldwin shop close sinc storm best afford restor build repair numer fine old pedigre string instrument violin viola cello bass horribl damag lost machineri tool suppli file record true nightmar age 63 never thought would face ten thousand peopl new york ten thousand peopl new jersey part northeast live turn upsid dismay sadden hous repres walk away last nightdidnt even touch thisaft spent much time floor someth help beleagu part countri happi help katrina happi help violent storm hit joplin mo move quickli month peopl still suffer governor cuomo governor christi done best limit resourc avail disast occur known law act god one knew come one idea terribl storm would damag perfect storm differ element work creat terribl situat repeat dismay sadden hous repres adjourn last night without address press need peopl still hundr thousand peopl dont place live whose home busi damag destroy indic mr kolstein terribl disast heartbreak leav victim sandi strand wait help storm damag destroy 700 000 home new york new jersey new england power help countrymen put live back togeth senat sent hous repres walk away postal reform agricultur reform farm bill walk away mani differ thing year left peopl without help gone left washington disappoint turn backsand dont includ oper anyon senat work bipartisan basi get done deepli disappoint hous repres turn back peopl suffer pleas understand everybodi includ leadership leader pelosi leader hoyer done best gather troop help time anyth need walk away peopl american wintertim disast strike fire flood storm earthquak past havent paus dont delay american respond hast nation level american live stake american commun shatter wonder peopl feel congress left town need better postal reform bill farm bill farm bill way save 24 billionnot million billion debbi stabenow chairman agricultur committe work hard get done bipartisan bill pass senat overwhelmingli hous repres drop well drop porkbarrel program help peopl dont need help farm program taken bill shortterm extens benefit peopl dont deserv still get need better compromis hard know sometim compromis doesnt happen want compromis sometim doesnt satisfi either side said place practic law concept good settlement side walk unhappi reach settlement night last actual yesterday well midnight piec legisl werent elat move ball forward mani hard decis make year ahead unlik other behind us capitol go stoop namecal want peopl work need let hous repres work let democrat republican hous repres debat easier time set rule debat rule committe set long debat subject let bodi work hasnt happen sad day turn back million fellow american time greatest need certainli happen

42,IL.DURBIN,IL,Durbin,"Mr. President, I want to join in the remarks of the majority leader. What a disappointment to learn that last night the House of Representatives failed to bring up the supplemental appropriations bill, which is to provide relief for the victims of Hurricane Sandy.
The Senate passed this bill not that long ago--just a few days ago. Mr. President, $60.4 billion in a supplemental appropriations passed here by a vote of 62 to 32--a strong bipartisan vote. It did not include everything the Governors of New York and New Jersey and other States had asked for, but it did provide critical funding to help those who lost their homes and their businesses.
We expected the House to act on this bill. To say this is a no-brainer is to overstate the obvious. We rally as an American family when many of us are in need. I can remember this very well in my own State.
In 2008, Illinois and other Midwestern States had a similar situation. A massive storm was heading our way and flooding from the Mississippi River was inevitable. I visited several towns along the Mississippi back then, including Quincy, IL. Then-Senator Obama and I came to Quincy and pitched in--filling sandbags with thousands of other volunteers.
We worked through Father's Day to help mitigate the oncoming flood, but it still came, and there was serious damage. Just like the people in New York and New Jersey, these people did everything they could before and after and during the storm to save their homes, businesses, and the lives of their loved ones. But the magnitude of our 2008 storm was too big for local and State governments to handle.
The magnitude of the flood, just like Hurricane Sandy, required action from Congress and the Federal Government. We passed a supplemental appropriations bill for Illinois and the Midwest in 2008. That aid was essential to helping the victims of that flood in our State.
I have served in Congress for over 20 years, and every time--every time--some section of our Nation has been victimized by a disaster, we have come together as an American family to help those in need. We draw on our national treasure and the efforts of American people across the country to come to the rescue of our neighbors in need.
The time to help New York and New Jersey and other States victimized by Hurricane Sandy is now, but the Republican leadership in the House has abandoned those victims with a decision to let this bill die. In New York and New Jersey more than 651,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, 463,000 businesses were hurt and need assistance. According to the Senators from those States, that either matches or exceeds the magnitude of the disaster of Hurricane Katrina that struck the States on our southern coast on the Gulf of Mexico.
Hundreds of miles of roads and rail were damaged and will need to be repaired. However, the rebuilding is on hold because of a political decision by the Speaker of the House and Republican leadership. I can tell you, I know full well--because Senator Schumer is in the leadership, and I have watched as he and Senator Gillibrand, Senator Menendez, Senator Lautenberg, and others have worked to build a bipartisan coalition in the House to pass this critical measure--all it needed was to be called by the Speaker, and the Speaker refused.
But there is still time. There is time in the 112th Congress for the House to pass the Senate bill. I urgently beg the Speaker of the House of Representatives to put any political concerns aside, and for the sake of these victims and victims of other disasters across America to pass this critically important bill as quickly as possible.
I yield the floor.

44,AL.SESSIONS,AL,Sessions,"Mr. President, I want to say some things that are pretty hard right now. I say them out of affection and concern for the Senate of the United States and for the way we are conducting the people's business. I believe they ought to be heard and all of us ought to think about them. Some of our new Members have not been involved in a Senate that functioned differently than the one in which we are participating today. They do not know how a real Senate should operate. We have gradually, and at a very accelerated pace in more recent years, made some very unwise choices about how we do the people's business.
This has been the most dysfunctional Senate in history. The majority has abused and altered the powers and duties of the Senate more than at any time in history, to the detriment of the institution and to the detriment of the public interest.
That is a hard thing to say, but I truly believe something very unfortunate has been occurring and people have not talked about it. I would also criticize the Republicans a bit here because we are supposed to be the loyal opposition. The majority always has pressures on it to advance an agenda and the loyal opposition has the duty to advocate for its views and make sure the institution is handled in a way that protects the institution as the majority seeks to advance its agenda. Frankly, I do not think we have done a good enough job at that. But I would say the majority is using tactics--I refer to them as postmodern tactics--to advance an agenda. And in so doing has done damage to the institution.
Our leader, Senator Reid, will not acknowledge a single error in his aggressive leadership and movement of legislation. He simply blames all the problems on Republicans who, he says, are obstructing his vision, his goals, and the agenda that he and his team want to advance. Not satisfied that these actions have brought the Senate to one of its lowest levels of public respect in history, if not the lowest, the majority party is now demanding even more power.
The majority leader and the majority are threatening to violate the rules of the Senate and change the rules of the Senate so they can grab even more power. I would say the majority leader himself has obtained more power than any leader in history, and now it appears that he is asking for more.
We don't like to talk about this. We are reluctant to talk about what is happening and be as critical as I am today, but in fact we have been silent too long. The bottom line is that this issue is not just about politics. This issue is about the historic role of the Senate and our constitutional order.
This Senate is not functioning as it should, and that is for sure; we all may agree on that. The question is, Why? Perhaps it was due to the 2010 election when the Democrats took a shellacking and lost six Senate seats. At that point there seemed to be a doubling down of the desire and ability of the majority leadership to dominate this institution. Actual Senate rules and actual codified law--and certainly the traditions of the Senate--were eroded. They were changed and run over.
The Republicans who fought back were called obstructionists. I don't know, but maybe when someone has been in power for a long time--as the leadership and the Democratic side has--they begin to think they are entitled to get all these things done. They believe they are entitled to bring up bills and not have Senators offer amendments so they can slow down the train and pick and choose what amendments the opposition can offer and how long they can debate. Maybe this goes in their mind in a way that when they get in that cocoon of power, everybody becomes an obstructionist when they simply insist on the rules of the Senate.
I always thought one of Senator Reid's charms--the old Harry Reid I knew--was that he could actively and aggressively talk politically and stick it to the opposition. He always got to the point. Sometimes I could admire his skills. He could do it with a smile. We all tolerate a little political license and a certain amount of political exaggeration in the world we live in, but I thought Senator Reid would not seek to advance powers beyond what he understood were the limits of the majority in the Senate because he has been in the minority, and he has operated there. He had to fight for his rights to have full minority rights. So I am a little baffled. I am not sure I understand this new Senator Reid, and I am not sure all of the decisions he is making are good.
Now we are talking about a nuclear option that would break the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the Senate. That is a very dangerous thing, and I do not believe it is necessary.
Let me describe what is happening. I want to make a complaint about how this Senate has been operating. I said it is dysfunctional. The majority has said the reason it is dysfunctional is because Republicans object too much and they are obstructionists. Let me point out some of the things that are actually occurring.
First, I would dispute that. I don't believe it is accurate that Republicans object too much and are obstructionists. I don't believe Republicans are any more vigorous in their defense of their ideas than the Democrats were when they were in the minority when I came to the Senate 16 years ago. I know they were not. So it is the little constraints that we operate under every day, such as rules, tradition, actual statutory law that controls how we conduct our business that are being eroded, gone around, and run over. These are the things that make the institution what it is. A person has to be able to accept the fact that those who disagree with them have at least some power and a right to have their voices and ideas heard and their amendments brought up. That is one of the great traditions of the Senate.
So I say--sort of metaphorically--I am going to tack on the walls of the Senate a few charges. I don't take pleasure in this, but it is time to tell the truth about it.
First, to a degree unknown in the history of the Senate, the majority leader has used his power under rule XIV to bring bills straight to the floor without normal committee process. They are violating and avoiding the process that goes on in committee where Members offer amendments, have debates, call expert witnesses, and consider these things. It may take weeks or months, but finally a bill ripens and it is then brought to the floor.
The majority leader does have the power under rule XIV to bring a bill to the floor without having had that committee process. The committee process is public, the debate is transcribed, and the amendments in the committee are voted on and recorded. It holds the Senators accountable so the public and their constituents know what they have done, how a bill is progressing, and at the end of the day whether they think they like it or not.
For example, this last-minute fiscal cliff tax legislation didn't go through the committee process. It was a big, important piece of legislation. We have a finance committee that is supposed to debate and decide tax issues. That did not occur with this bill. Additionally, no amendments were allowed to this bill--because it was brought directly to the floor by the majority leader. It is a very bad process. We are too often using midnight-hour votes to ram through big, historic legislation that has never been fully debated. We didn't even have an opportunity to fully read the legislation the night before last. That is not the way to run the Senate. What we know now from a preliminary estimate from the Congressional Research Service is that 58 percent of the bills which came to the floor of the Senate did not come through committee during this Congress. Nearly 60 percent of the legislation was not brought through traditional Senate committee procedures, and that is not good.
Second, the majority leader and the majority were quick to block President Bush's recess appointment attempts. Some of them were dubious; some of them were probably OK. They had the majority. They have done nothing to defend the Senate's historic and constitutional role when President Obama made a much more blatant recess appointment. The institution itself was weakened by this act. The Senate has to defend its legitimate confirmation powers, and there is a limit on the President's ability to initiate recess appointments.
The majority leader--righteous to defend it against President Bush--who is now the leader of this institution, has allowed President Obama to weaken the confirmation process. That goes beyond just the politics of the moment. Maybe it furthers a long-term agenda, but clearly does harm to the long-term interest of the Senate.
Third, the majority has directly violated the formal role of the Senate and plain statutory law that requires the Senate to produce a budget every year. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 sets up a public legislative process--a public process--by which both the House and Senate must openly confront the Nation's fiscal challenges every year and lay out a plan. For 3 years the majority in this Senate has refused to comply with the law simply to avoid public accountability.
The majority leader said it would be foolish to have a budget. Those are his words. Senator Conrad, chairman of the Budget Committee, was clearly uneasy about this. Senator Conrad was determined--at least in his committee, which I serve on with him--to bring up a budget. We were going to discuss it, mark it up, and then it would be up to the majority leader whether he would ever bring it to the floor because he didn't bring it to the floor the year before.
We have now gone 3 years without bringing a budget to the floor. Apparently, the majority had a caucus within a day of the Budget Committee markup occurring. My staff had studied it, made amendments, and we were going to offer ideas to the budget. But the markup was canceled. Only a shell of this matter went forward. There were no votes, no formal budget process or budget offered. That is directly contrary to the statute of the United States.
The Budget Act requires an open process with committee votes, floor votes, and 50 hours of debate in which Senators who propose or oppose a budget have to do so publicly and with accountably. People should be able to offer amendments so we can have a vote on them.
Senator Reid was thinking it was foolish to have his Members actually have to vote on concrete budget proposals. He didn't want them to do so. Apparently, the previous election had not gone well enough, and he wanted to protect his Members from those votes. That is what he meant by being foolish. It was foolish politically for the Democratic Party, but certainly we know it was not foolish for the American people that the Senate would actually discuss the financial future of our country and bring up a budget. A budget can be passed with a simple majority. Republicans cannot filibuster a budget. They get to offer amendments--for a change around here--but they don't get to filibuster it. They get an up-or-down vote--50 votes--after 50 hours of debate.
The leader violated plain statutory law, which requires us to have a budget by April 15 because he didn't want his Members to be accountable, but he blames Republicans for being obstructionists.
Fourth, for the first time in history, the Senate has abdicated the most fundamental requirement of Congress: responsible management of the money that the American people send here. We violated that requirement. Not a single appropriations bill was brought to the floor this year--not 1. That is the first time in history. We researched this--there has never been a time in history when not a single appropriations bill was brought up before the Senate. Frequently we don't get them all done, so then a continuing resolution has to be passed to keep the government from being shut down.
Congress is supposed to pass the appropriations bills telling the President, and all his Cabinet people, how much money they have to spend in the next fiscal year that begins October 1 of every year. The President cannot spend any money Congress has not appropriated. That is a fundamental requirement of the Senate. That is not just an idle idea, it is a fundamental requirement.
So we get to the end of the year and nothing has been done so we passed a continuing resolution, a CR. We stacked 13 bills--1,000-plus pages of spending--in one continuing resolution, and we just funded the government with no amendments, no debate, and no discussion for 6 months. That is no way to run a government. Each one of those bills is supposed to be brought up: defense, highways, education, health care. People who have amendments are supposed to bring up ways to save money or spend more money on each one of those bills, and we are supposed to vote on them. For the first time in history we did not do that.
Perhaps this was a clever political maneuver. It avoided public debate and public accountability because we had an election coming up in November and we don't want to vote before an election.
Another example is the Defense Authorization Bill. The fiscal year concluded this year without us passing the Defense Bill. The Senate has passed the Defense Bill for 50 consecutive years. Yet, just a few weeks ago, well after the elections, we were finally able to pass the Defense bill.
The House has sent over a budget that lays out a firm financial course for America. They voted on that budget in public. They were prepared to defend and explain their budget. It would have changed the debt course of America. But what did the Senate do? Nothing. Did Republicans filibuster the budget? Did they block a budget from being brought up? No. Republicans demanded that we go through the process. We pleaded with them to have a budget hearing in the committee. We asked them to bring up the budget and noted that they have the power to pass a budget with a simple majority. That is a burden a majority party has, really--to bring up a budget and pass it. It is not easy. It is a challenge. But it is the first time we have ever gone 3 years--or maybe the first time ever we have gone through the situation in which they refused to even bring up a budget. We have had budgets fail in the past, but we haven't had one, to my knowledge, where we just go for years and refuse to even bring one up.
In that secret Budget Control Act deal, we set spending limits on most of the discretionary spending caps, but that is not a budget. There were no amendments. There were no public discussions, no committee hearings, no floor debate, no 50 hours to deal with the great issues of our time.
One more point. The majority leader has been trigger-happy in filing cloture motions. We have altered the way the Senate operates. We have to plead with somebody to be able to get an amendment in the Senate today. It is amazing. This goes against the history of this institution.
The two great guarantees in the Senate, as Robert Byrd, the great majority leader and historian of the Senate, has said, are the right to debate and the right to amend. Those are fundamental. We are seeing an erosion of both.
So what does this cloture motion do? Senator Reid said: I am going to bring up a certain bill, and the Republicans can have five amendments.
Well, we have 15 amendments we want to debate--maybe more--on a bill. Somebody reminded me that the Panama Canal bill had 80 votes to give away the Panama Canal. It eventually got two-thirds votes and passed. It went through weeks of debate and lots of amendments. That is what the Senate is about. Now they say no amendments. So that begins to cause a problem.
The majority leader says: You have to filibuster. You won't agree to my limited number of amendments. You are obstructing. I am going to file the bill and immediately file cloture to end debate. So 30 hours goes by, has the vote to end debate, and says: All this time, the Republicans have been filibustering.

The phrase he keeps using is ``break the rules to change the rules.''
This goes to my question: Is the Senator aware that under the Constitution, and specifically article I, section 5, it says that the Senate may determine the rules of its proceedings?
As far as I know--and we have a letter we are going to have printed in the Record later--almost all constitutional scholars in this country as well as three Vice Presidents sitting up there where Senator Cardin is sitting, presiding, have ruled that at the beginning of a Congress, on the first legislative day, the Senate is allowed to change the rules. And the Constitution trumps the Senate rules in that respect in that very early period.

But I am not aware of that ever happening. I would ask my good attorney general colleague, who is familiar and understands tradition and the power of precedent, what would keep a Republican majority next year--or if they were to obtain one in the Senate--from changing the rules again and again and again?
The tradition in this Senate has been that to change the rules, we use a two-thirds vote, and we have adhered to that rule. There have been some threats to do the nuclear option, they call it, to use a simple majority to change the rules of the Senate, but it has not happened. I think that is a dangerous thing.
I would also ask my colleague to consider that because he is a young and popular Senator, and he is going to be here a long time--longer than I--and he may be in the minority. That might be a dangerous thought and it may be unimaginable for him today, but it can happen. We had 55 Senators just a few years ago. In two cycles, the Republicans went from 55 to 40.
So I just would say to the Senator, be careful about this. I know the Senator believes in debating, and he is capable at it, and he doesn't want to be able to put us in circumstances that would endanger that.
The point I was making is this: The problem in the Senate is not fundamentally the rules of the Senate; the problem in the Senate is a desire by the majority to move its agenda with a minimum of objection and to eliminate frustrating procedures that obstruct their ability to do what they think is good for America.
But I had that view too. When we had the majority, we wanted to pass the Bush tax cuts, 99 percent of which were extended 2 nights ago--the Bush tax cuts, which were passed for a limited period of time--10 years. Why? Because it took 60 votes to pass the tax cuts and our Democratic colleagues didn't want those tax cuts passed. It was passed through the budget. We requested to only do a 10-year budget. So they were passed as part of the budget process with 50 votes, but they could only last 10 years and then they expire. So that is the rule. They got extended. President Obama extended them once, but we got to the end, and they were about to expire on January 1, and everybody's taxes were going to go up. We had to pass a law to keep that from happening, and a compromise eventually was reached where most of the taxes stayed where they were and the taxes on the rich went up.

The reason I ask that question is because my understanding is that the effort to control the amendment process by the majority leader has been limited to two things: No. 1, the number of amendments, which makes a lot of sense when we consider that the very small bill to raise the minimum wage that Senator Kennedy offered when I first got here--I was sitting where Senator Cardin from Maryland is now presiding watching this debate take place on the floor, and they got to over 100 amendments on a one- or two-page bill. The Senate could never get to the bill if Members had to spend the rest of the session going through all these amendments. So to limit the number of amendments seems reasonable.
The other restriction that I think sometimes the majority seeks to impose is that the amendments be germane. I know when I was working with a number of colleagues of the distinguished Senator from Alabama on trying to form a bipartisan solution to the cyber compromise, every time the Republicans and the Democrats got together, we would start our discussion with the same back-and-forth, and that would be the Republicans saying----",RI,WHITEHOUSE,-0.527,D,mr presid question distinguish senat alabama high regard rank member judiciari committe rank member budget committe share experi serv u attorney great admir heard say someth brought floor practic major leader seek pick choos amend minor may offer question distinguish senat alabama overst case identifi time major leader ever said minor parti bring amend one reason ask question understand effort control amend process major leader limit two thing 1 number amend make lot sens consid small bill rais minimum wage senat kennedi offer first got herei sit senat cardin maryland presid watch debat take place floor got 100 amend one twopag bill senat could never get bill member spend rest session go amend limit number amend seem reason restrict think sometim major seek impos amend german know work number colleagu distinguish senat alabama tri form bipartisan solut cyber compromis everi time republican democrat got togeth would start discuss backandforth would republican say

55,RI.WHITEHOUSE,RI,Whitehouse,Please do. The Senator from Alabama has heard my questions.,RI,WHITEHOUSE,-0.527,D,pleas senat alabama heard question
56,AL.SESSIONS,AL,Sessions,"This is a good question. Let me tell my colleague how it happens in the real world of the minority party.
Senator Reid will bring up a bill, and he will say he wants five amendments.
Senator McConnell will talk to Republicans, and they will say: Well, we have 15 amendments. We have a lot of things we want to vote on, some of them germane and some of them not germane.
Nongermane amendments are a historic and critical part of the history of the Senate. You two advocates would never want to give that up. I don't think my colleagues would if they have thought it through. And we are not going to give it up. We are not going to give up nongermane amendments, but there are limits on nongermane amendments.
So Senator McConnell says: Well, we have more amendments than that that we want.
Senator Reid says: I am filing the bill, and I am filling the tree, and nobody is going to get an amendment I don't approve.
So we said: Well, we have 15.
OK, Senator Reid says, I will take four.
Well, I have an amendment on immigration. I have one on taxes.
No, we are not going to vote on that one. We will take these three amendments, and that is it.
So Senator McConnell and his staff are talking to the Senators, saying: You have five amendments; I can only get you one. He will not accept this amendment. I have been told explicitly that you will not get this amendment or that amendment.
That is happening every day. And he will file cloture immediately and say the Republicans are filibustering when all we are doing is disputing whether or not we get 5 or 15 amendments. What are we here for if not to debate and offer amendments? Do my colleagues mean, in the great Senate of the United States, a Senator can bring up a bill--maybe small in language, about the minimum wage, but it is a matter that invokes philosophical disputes--I will just say it that way.
For the bankruptcy bill, I think there were 60 amendments on that bill. It was a bitterly contested piece of legislation. We had a good number of amendments. Finally, when the Defense bill was brought up after the election just a few weeks ago we were able to get amendments. But still it was less than one would normally expect on a bill spending $600 billion. Well, at least we got amendments. The bill came up--it came out of committee unanimously.
They would not bring it up before the election mainly because we needed to fix the sequester. Senator Reid did not want to talk about that, so he refused, for the first time in 50 years, to bring up the Defense bill. But it finally got brought up. It went through a fairly regular process. People got their amendments, and the bill passed overwhelmingly and will become law.
So that is what the Senate is all about. Talk to people who have been around here, and they will tell you that. I remember standing right there. Senator Specter was a great Senator with a fabulous legal mind. I wanted something. I wanted him to agree to put something in the bill, and he would not agree. He did not want any more amendments. He wanted to wrap it up and get the final vote.
We argued a bit back and forth, and he looked at me and said, in effect: Well, you are a Senator. If you want your amendment, you get your amendment. It interrupted his day, his schedule. But if I insisted, I got my amendment. You are a Senator; you get your amendment.
Well, Senator Paul, he files a lot of amendments. But he is a Senator. He got elected in Kentucky saying he was going to come to Congress and shake up this place. But he does not get an amendment? Senator Reid says: No, you do not get amendments, or you only get this one.
They tried to hold him off from offering an amendment to cut foreign aid. Do you remember that? He would not yield. It went on. He was threatened: You are stopping the bill; you are going to kill the bill. He would not back down.
Finally--finally--they gave him an amendment. It went down by a big vote. It did not pass, but he got to advocate and ask why we were giving aid to a country that was abusing the rights of its citizens, and so forth.
So that is what the Senate is all about. That is all I am saying. This idea of speed is dangerous if it is denying the right of members to debate and offer amendments--if it is altering the nature of this great institution.
Colleagues, I think as a practical matter we have had good success with stacking votes. So if a person wants to speak on a bill, they can speak at 6 or 7 or 8 o'clock at night, and the votes could be held the next morning. It does not take long to have votes, 15 minutes or so to have a vote. We could have more votes and people would be satisfied.
With regard to nongermane amendments, I would suggest they do not come up again and again and again. Somebody campaigned on not giving foreign aid to Egypt, and they came here and they wanted to have an amendment. No, you cannot have it. Well, they are not going to offer the amendment on every bill. They are not going to offer it every year. They just needed to be able to have the American people see this Congress vote on that issue.

Yes, in fact, it has been used, and it has been used a number of times.
I would point the Senator from Alabama to 1975. In 1975, we had the situation where a number of Democratic Senators were pushing for a change in the rules. The filibuster threshold at that point was 67 votes, unlike 60 today. Actually, that was the time period when they moved that threshold from 67 to 60.
What happened was 51 Senators took to the floor and three times voted down the attempt to move away from changing the rules.
Now, I would also note that three Vice Presidents--sitting up where Senator Cardin, the Presiding Officer, is right now--have ruled that at the beginning of a Congress--at the beginning of a Congress--you are allowed, the Senate, 51 Senators, to step forward and say: We would like new rules.

71,AL.SESSIONS,AL,Sessions,"I thank the Senator for his advocacy, but I do believe that final vote to change the rule was by a two-thirds vote. If you get a two-thirds vote, you can impose your will--when we do it. The question is, Can you change the rule by a simple majority? I would say the Constitution does not say what the vote level should be, and it may be possible lawfully to ignore the Senate rule that says it takes a two-thirds vote to change the rules on the first day of session. It may be possible legally to do that.
But I would urge my colleagues not to do that. Just for short-term political gain, we are going to change the historic rules of the Senate, changing the rules of debate in this kind of way? It would be a dangerous alteration of the nature of the Senate, as so many of our more seasoned colleagues have warned us. I will just urge you not to do that.
I will say to both of my fine colleagues that an offer has been made, one I think I am not real happy with, by Senator McConnell. Negotiations are under way now to try to resolve some of the difficulties that are ongoing. But I would urge you to pull back and not pull the trigger on what has been called the nuclear option--to use a simple majority to change the rules of the Senate--which could change the very nature of how we do business and the qualities of the Senate that make it different from the House. That is my concern there.
So the filling of the tree--one more thing I would like to say about that. I had a chart on it. I think Trent Lott used filling the tree eleven times; Bill Frist, fifteen; it was used one or two times by previous majority leaders. But it has grown, and Senator Reid has filled the tree 70 times already.
Basically, without going into details, filling the amendment tree allows the majority leader to block amendments. Historically, there was no limit on amendments in the Senate. If a Senator had an amendment, he came to the floor and offered the amendment, and he would try to be courteous and not abuse his power, but he got a vote on the issues he believed were important.
We should not limit that. We should not have the majority leader rejecting certain amendments because he does not like them. Really the reason he rejects them is they are often tough amendments, uncomfortable votes for the Members of his conference, and he does not want a vote on a tough issue. So, he blocks it from ever being voted on to protect the Members from that.
I heard Senator Merkley--I see him on the floor--talk about his vision for a more open Senate. I have heard him talk about how he conducted himself as the speaker of the house in his home State and how it was more vigorous in debate, in open debate.
In sum, my colleagues, this is what has happened: The biggest change by far, the thing that is causing the angst in the Senate and disrupting the Senate--other than the majority's fundamental determination to avoid responsibility and avoid voting on the tough issues of this country; and that is a big one, and I have detailed that--but the fundamental thing is, this majority leader is consistently using the device of filling the tree to block the free flow of amendments, to reject certain amendments he does not like, and control the Senate in a way that is contrary to our history, contrary to our tradition, and contrary to the public interest.
We are having too much of the majority leader bringing up bills like this last fiscal cliff legislation. I warned months ago we were going to end up at the 11th hour and 59th minute. I wrote in the Wall Street Journal a month ago, they are waiting until the 11th hour, the 59th minute to bring up the bill so you have no amendments, you do not even get to read the thing--do not even get to read it. You get a summary of it--have to vote yes or no--or we go over the cliff. That is not the way this business ought to be done.
So I urge my good, vigorous colleagues, who believe in debate and openness, not to shut off debate, not to move in that direction, to focus on an open process by which these matters are debated openly and the American people can determine whom they agree with.
They might not like what I have to say. They might vote me out of office.

As I was listening back in my office to the Senator's presentation, and he may have enhanced it while I was walking over here, but the Senator was noting, essentially, what sounds like a very one-sided piece of the puzzle; that is, that the majority leader or the floor manager is in a position of negotiating or restraining what amendments the minority does. However, the Senator might be unaware that it is actually two-sided in that it is traditional for the floor leader on the Senator's side or the minority leader, the Republican leader, to also veto the Democratic amendments. Of course, I have had untold dozens of my amendments vetoed from being presented.
So you have this negotiation that is taking place between the leaders on the two sides over what they will admit. That hits both sides equally, basically, because your amendments may be ruled out; my amendments may be ruled out. Your leader may actually not like your amendment, and may say to you: Well, the other side will never agree to your amendment. Actually, it may be your own leader killing it.

As Arlen Specter said to me: Well, I do not agree, but you are a Senator. You want your amendment, you get your amendment.
That is the way the Senate is supposed to work.

86,AL.SESSIONS,AL,Sessions,"Reclaiming the floor, I think the Senator is correct. I would say both--it is not good. Why should they be picking your amendments? Why should Senator McConnell be picking your amendments? It is flabbergasting to me about how we came to this point. It is like a frog in the warming water. You have come to the process in the middle of it where the traditional rights of a Senator have been eroded, and you are trying to deal with that situation and craft a solution that is dealing with an alteration of our historical procedure. We should go back to those.
When I asked the question about time--and how few amendments we have and actually get votes on--I think people should understand what I am saying. The Senate will not slow down. It will not slow down if we have amendments. Most Senators will agree to make their arguments at a time when something else isn't happening on the floor. They get their vote, maybe the next day. I don't think that is the problem. The problem is leaders want to control the debate. I think those of us underlings sitting at the kiddie table, as somebody said, need to get in the game.
There is no constitutional power given to the majority leader or the minority leader. It is a matter of courtesy. As far as I am concerned, they work for us. They work for the Members of the Senate. We don't work for them, they work for us. They are supposed to facilitate our rights as Senators. We have acquiesced and allowed an erosion of those rights.
A person is not going to offer his amendment every month, every year. In a 2-year term, Senator Paul stood in there and finally got his amendment on foreign aid to Egypt. He is not going to offer it again next week. He had his vote and he lost.
I think there is just as much a hullabaloo about nothing if we would turn, quit filling the tree, quit attempting to control the flow of amendments in this body, we would shock ourselves how much better this body operates. I am tired of having to ask people for permission to file an amendment. That is where we are, and you should not have to do it.
The majority leader has got 1 vote out of 100, and I have got 1 vote out of 100. They meet in secret; they plot this bill on taxes. It comes up at the 11th hour. We don't get to read it and we don't get to amend it. Every Senator here and their constituents has been diminished in power by having that happen. We have got to stand up, all of us, Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, and defend the system. It will be better if we let it run as it is supposed to run--good debate, good amendments, stand before the American people, be accountable for what you did, and go back home and defend your record.
I know there are some tough votes. It was a tough vote for me last night. I voted for that bill. I am not sure I did right, but I was confident it was the right thing to do. But I didn't like it because I didn't get to read it sufficiently. I didn't get to know what was in it sufficiently. It had things in it I didn't like. But in the long run I thought it was going to be best for the country to move this issue behind us and move on, so I would say that also.
The majority leader's sole power and strength comes from the ability to be recognized first. The majority basically selects Senator Cardin to preside. They trust him to preside. When the majority leader hits the floor, Senator Cardin is going to recognize the man who selected him. The majority leader of the majority party and all the presiding officers are members of the majority party--and I used to preside in that fashion when we had the majority. That is the way the system works.
I would conclude by telling my colleagues I have enjoyed this discussion and leave one bit of warning. If this were to go to the nuclear option and substantial changes were made to the free debate and the free right to amend in the Senate, this will not be accepted. It will be a historic and dramatic change in the nature of the Senate. This Senate--I have now talked to Members--will not go quietly. It will not be treated as a legitimate change. We will resist in every way possible, and we will have a most disagreeable and difficult time in the body. So I would urge my colleagues, keep working with this compromise and maybe something could come out of it. Everybody can accept advancing some of the ideas you would like and maybe dealing with some of the concerns I would like.
One more example of how this political body should operate was the Democratic majority--the minority, when President Bush was elected--decided to filibuster Federal judges for the first time, systematically filibuster them. They were holding up nine, I believe, judges of high order. It went on for weeks, over a year, as I recall. Senator Frist threatened that they would use this procedure, or something like it. The result of that was a Gang of 14 reached an agreement and said there wouldn't be a filibuster of judges except in extraordinary circumstances. So the nuclear option never took place, the rules were never changed, but Members of the body in a collegial fashion agreed that, okay, we won't eliminate filibusters entirely, but we will only do it in extraordinary circumstances.
I think the best wisdom at this point is to draw back from the nuclear option to see if we can improve the way the Senate works and at that point we could perhaps improve the institution without endangering its fundamental character.

87,RI.WHITEHOUSE,RI,Whitehouse,"Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Alabama for his comments today. I think they are helpful in moving us forward, and I hope very much that we can find a way to go forward without having to use the constitutional doctrine that at the beginning of each Congress the Senate has an opportunity to adjust its rules with 51 votes. I think that is constitutional doctrine at this point.
I reject the notion that it is breaking the rules to take advantage of that constitutional moment. But the Senator makes a fair point that from a point of view of precedent--very different than breaking the rules, but from the point of view of precedent--it sets a new standard that we should be very cautious about going to.
I strongly support the Senator's recommendation that there needs to be a more vibrant amendment process. I believe the status of the discussion is regarding the filibuster on the motion to proceed, that if the majority leader is able to move to procedure without a filibuster, there will be amendments under that rule.

This is a tradition; this is a way we operate.
Each one of us is 1 of 100. We are equal in our responsibilities and in our ultimate voting power if we don't allow it to be eroded. As I understand the rule, there would be four amendments, you know, guaranteed up front by leaders. Think about that, as I know you will be active, both of you, in the discussion of how to write these compromises, and I am hopeful we will reach one. But I wouldn't, in a nonpartisan comment--I am not sure we ought to further embed in our rules superpowers to one Senator or another group of Senators. Has the Senator thought about that?

93,RI.WHITEHOUSE,RI,Whitehouse,"I appreciate the point the Senator from Alabama is commenting on, and I think it is important that we recognize that is a floor or a minimum number of amendments and not a ceiling. I think the more we can allow Senators amendments, the better institution this will be.
That said, the calendar is unyielding. Days come and days go, Congresses end, work periods end. The majority leader and minority leader have the responsibility for trying to fit the work into those time periods. Clearly there is the prospect of vexatious amendments, either in nature or in number, whose purpose is to interfere with their ability to manage the floor in a sensible way for all of us. I think we do have to be prepared to defend against that, and I think number and germaneness are the usual touchstones.
The story I was telling, when the Senator from Alabama reclaimed his time, was of the cyber negotiations. When the Republicans and Democrats met together, the opening moment of virtually every discussion was the Republicans saying, when we get this bill to the floor, there will be amendments, correct? We were saying, absolutely, that is our understanding, we will stand by you having your amendments, but let us have them be germane, let us have them be relevant to cyber. That was always kind of a mutual agreement going forward until a Senator came to the floor and gave notice that they would insist on a repeal ObamaCare amendment on any cyber bill. That threw a pretty big spanner into the works of what I thought was moving toward a good bipartisan solution there.
I think we have real problems here in terms of the abuse of the filibuster. When the majority leader can say that Lyndon Johnson as majority leader faced 1 filibuster, and this majority leader has, I think he said, 291 times--391 times had to file cloture, that is a pretty big change.
When you see judges who have been cleared in the Judiciary Committee unanimously sitting on the Executive Calendar in what has become a hostage pool for purposes of trading--these are judges who are ready to go, and there may very well be a judicial emergency in their district; they have Republican and Democratic support, and they are held hostage to be used as trading pieces on either judges or other issues--I think that is a very poor way to go about doing business, particularly when you consider where that leaves an individual who has put their life on hold waiting to see if they will be confirmed, and all they are is a pawn in a chess game, even though everybody thinks that substantively they are qualified and should serve as judges.
You see situations in which we have a cloture fight and then, when we actually have the vote, the measure passes with 90-plus votes. Clearly, there was not a great dispute over that. That is cloture being used for obstruction and to, I believe, take those 30-hour blocks of cloture time and stack them up into a wall of obstruction.
I will say one final thing and then I will yield the floor. The good Senator from Alabama mentioned the budget process, and he is our ranking member on budget, so he knows this very well, but I have to dispute his description of the budget not passing and of why the majority leader said it would be foolish to have a budget.
The reason it would have been foolish to have a budget is because we had a budget. In the ordinary course, a budget is developed from the committee up. We start in the Budget Committee. We propose a budget. It then goes to the Senate floor. We have budget day, which is often irreverently called a vote-arama, where we vote and vote and vote on amendments, and we ultimately get a budget. A similar process happens in the House. The President then has a budget to work with and we go forward.
In this case, because the question of the Nation's budget is such a hot political issue, the budget was negotiated at the very top, between the President and the Speaker and the Senate leadership, and it was passed into law. We didn't pass a budget; we passed a bill. We passed a law, and the law set the budget. So when your budget is being set by law, yes, it is a little foolish to go through the process as if none of that had happened and try to build a budget from the ground up when it has already been established by law and when we wouldn't change it with our budget procedures. It has already been established by law, by negotiations at the highest level.
So I think that is why it was foolish. I think the budget process will continue to go forward in circumstances in which we are building a budget from the ground up, the way we do in the ordinary course, but I do think it was important to clarify that.

101,RI.WHITEHOUSE,RI,Whitehouse,"I think that is true, and nobody is more alert to this than the Senator from Oregon, but it is my belief there has been a little transformation in the nature of the filibuster. It always used to be the individual right of individual Senators to get up on their feet and to say their piece, to hold the floor for as long as they needed to and to speak themselves--to read the Bible, to read the Constitution, to read the phonebook--into exhaustion. They did so when they felt deeply about an issue, when they were deeply opposed to something on the floor.
Then cloture came along and it established a 30-hour block of time for debate. But, tellingly, it didn't require anyone to do any debating during those 30 hours. My belief is the minority party figured out if they filibustered everything, including very popular bills and amendments and judges that normally pass with huge majorities--up in the nineties--then each time the majority leader has to file cloture we end up with another 30-hour block of floor time that can't be used for anything productive. If that is done hundreds of times, that becomes thousands of hours of floor time, and it is very often why people who are watching us, expecting to see debates on the floor, see the tedious quorum call. They see our wonderful floor staff quietly reading the names of the Senators as the quorum call drones on and nothing is happening.
That puts immense pressure on the majority because they now have less and less and less time to work with because these 30-hour bites of time over and over again have been taken out of the year and it makes doing business very difficult.
That, I believe, has been the transformation. We have changed from being a Senate where an individual Senator has the right to get on his or her feet and oppose anything with a filibuster for as long as they can stand on their feet to a Senate where the minority filibusters everything, creating these 30-hour blocks of dead time which puts great pressure on the body to try to get things done in the time that remains. That is my view of why we are where we are and why it is important to change the rules.
I will yield after saying I do think the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from New Mexico have done this body a great service by their leadership on pressing forward on rules changes. I think it is very clear that however this ends up turning out, the majority leader has 51 votes for a change to put the Senate back on a footing where it is behaving as a Senate again and we are not spending our time in the dead zone of endless quorum calls.

105,NM.UDALL,NM,Udall,"I thank my colleague very much, and let me say to my colleague from Oregon, who has been a real leader on this, he has been diligent, he has studied this, he cares about it, and he has been a great partner. The packages that were voted on the last time we helped put those together--and there were two very significant votes, as Senator Merkley realizes. We came very close. We had 44 votes for a package that would make 4 or 5 changes and then his package on the talking filibuster, which was included in both packages, received 46 votes. That showed that if we had the opportunity at the beginning of a Congress to change the rules under the Constitution, we were very close to the 51 votes.
I just want to comment on what my colleague from Rhode Island said earlier--Senator Whitehouse--and repeat that because we have been counting the votes over the last couple months. We have been trying to determine if the votes are there in order to be able to change the rules, and we know at the beginning of a Congress that we need 51 votes.
I also want to respond to several things that were going on here earlier on the floor. Several Senators made statements, and several of those statements were from the other side. I believe they should be responded to because we are in this crucial phase in terms of adopting the rules.
The first issue that comes up is this issue of breaking the rules to change the rules. This has been what has been repeated numerous times in the last couple months with our Republican friends and colleagues coming to the floor. They use the phrase ``break the rules to change the rules.''
In fact, when we use the Constitution, there is no conflict with the Senate rules because three Vice Presidents have ruled from the chair, where Senator Cardin is now sitting, that at the beginning of a Congress, on that first legislative day, we can change the rules, and we do it pursuant to the Constitution.
The Constitution, at article I, section 5, says the Senate can determine the rules of its proceedings. Every constitutional scholar I know of who has looked at this realizes that is the window--that first legislative day--in order to deal with the rules. So when, in fact, we legislate on that day in a rules context, we are not breaking the rules; we are creating the rules for the coming Congress--in this case, the 113th Congress. We are creating the rules that will govern.
Do I think we should use the Constitution to change the rules every couple weeks after we put rules in place? Of course not. That is not fair to do. We would never be advocating for adopting rules and then changing them every couple weeks or every couple months. In that situation, there is a high threshold to change the rules, as it says in the Senate rules.
But I want to engage in this colloquy with my colleague from Oregon, first of all, on this issue of the constitutional option and in terms of utilizing the constitutional option at the beginning of a Congress; putting the rules in place and then following the rules throughout the Congress. I ask my colleague: Isn't that the way we are intending to move?
Then, secondly, the heart of the matter--and this is where Mr. Merkley, the distinguished Senator from Oregon, has been instrumental in terms of helping us deal with the dysfunctional filibuster system we have right now--we have a secret filibuster. We have a silent filibuster--in fact, we have way too many filibusters. Just to give a little comparison, when LBJ--Lyndon Baines Johnson--was majority leader for 6 years in the 1950s, he had one cloture motion filed--one filibuster. Harry Reid, whose office is just a few feet from here, as the President pro tempore knows, comes to the floor and he has had close to 400 filibusters in his 6 short years. So they have gotten completely out of hand.
One of the things I want to talk to my good colleague, the Senator from Oregon, about, in addition to this constitutional option--the small window we have tomorrow on the first legislative day--is also how do we remedy this situation in the Senate? Everyone acknowledges the Senate has become dysfunctional; that we are not doing the work of the American people. We hear our Republican colleagues say they do not like the way it is working. So I ask: What is the best way to get to the heart of that? Is it the talking filibuster? Is it trying to change the rules on the motion to proceed? How do we get at the heart of what the problem is?

106,OR.MERKLEY,OR,Merkley,"I thank my colleague from New Mexico. I am going to be very brief, because in 2 minutes I am taking the chair so my colleague from Maryland can continue with his schedule.
Indeed, the silent secret filibuster that is occurring in the Senate today is deadly. What it means is that after there has been a vote of 41 who say we want more debate, there is no more debate because no one is required to debate. Instead, they don't want to appear in front of the American people and make their case, and that is outrageous. If you are voting for more debate and you are going to take up the time of this institution, time it could be using to address many of the challenges that face America, then you should have the courage of your convictions to make your case on this floor before your colleagues, before your constituents, before the American public, and engage in that dialogue. If you don't feel you want to spend the time and energy to do that, then you should stand aside and we should proceed with a simple majority vote and address the issue at hand.
I do think we need to address that silent filibuster, that secret filibuster. The American people deserve to know why it is we are not getting their work done. And if they can see that it is being blocked by a group that is publicly making their case, they can either agree with them and say, That person is a hero, they are standing up to some core principle and we salute their efforts, or they can say they are a bum, because all they are trying to do is paralyze the Senate, they are not making any valuable points. And that feedback I think will help us resolve some of those filibusters.
In some cases folks have said, Well, isn't that going to eat up more of the Senate's time? And I respond, No, it is not. Because we are talking about what is now silent and hidden but paralyzing us being done in public, where there is actually a dialogue about the issue at hand and the public can participate. It is not the only thing that should be done, but it certainly is a key part of the formulation.
With that, in an hour or so I would be happy to rejoin the conversation.

107,NM.UDALL,NM,Udall,"Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon, because he has elucidated here the real issue that we face as a Senate.
The Senator from Maryland, who is presiding, knows well. He has worked on the rules, and I hope he will join me here for a minute to talk about the rules situation we are in and where we are headed.
There are several issues that are before us: How do we move into a more deliberative body? How do we move to the point where we get on to legislation, that we have amendments, we let everyone be heard, we let the minority be heard, and also at the end of the day be able to get to a majority vote? That is the way the Senate used to proceed, and now we have one Senator holding up the whole show.

We shouldn't be allowed to have that kind of situation with any Senator, and we need to give up that little bit of power to make the institution itself a better institution. This institution is a great institution. It has a lot of very capable people in it. But it is not responding to what the American people want us to do.

I agree with both Senators. If you are going to engage in extraordinary action such as a filibuster, you should be on the floor talking about it. That makes sense, that when the Senate is in session, we should be conducting business. We shouldn't have to go through extensive quorum calls because a single Senator is objecting to us proceeding. We want to get back to the traditions of the Senate where this becomes the greatest deliberative body in the world, where we debate issues and we resolve issues and we act on issues.
I was listening to the distinguished Senator from Alabama, and he was pointing out how he believes that the Senate is not working the way it should and that we should be debating more amendments. I think we should be debating more amendments. I think the key we need is that we need to change the way the Senate has acted and operated in recent times, and that means we need to get more legislation more quickly and actually debate bills. We have to have committees able to report out legislation that could be acted on on the floor of the Senate. We have got to bring issues to conclusion.
There are two problems here, as I see it: One, we have had individual Senators who have used their right to object to a unanimous consent, delaying almost indefinitely--in some cases killing--legislation from being able to move forward by a single objection, and a lot of times they are not even on the floor of the Senate to make that objection. They just through their leader say, We don't want this bill to move forward; and maybe, yes, we will let it move forward if you will let us have 50 amendments. That is the same as killing the bill.
So we have seen individual Senators exercising their right to object who have brought legislation to a standstill on the floor of the Senate. That is wrong. And as my distinguished colleague, the Senator from New Mexico, pointed out, the majority leader has had to file record numbers of clotures to end debate because the minority party, for whatever reason, has not allowed us to proceed with legislation for debate.
Normally the majority party has the right to determine the agenda of the Senate. They don't have the right to pass bills; that is up to a majority of the Senate. But the majority leader should have the right to bring a bill to the floor of the Senate. That has been denied over and over by the minority party. That is wrong.
I agree with my friend from Alabama that there should be the right to offer amendments. I think we should debate issues. I agree with that. But that hasn't been the problem. The problem has been that a certain number of Members have used their right to object, working through the Republican leader, blocking us from considering a lot of bills on the floor of the Senate.
So what do we need to do? We need to be able to first move legislation forward. We need to be able to bring bills out of our committees and have them on the floor for debate, get on the amendment process.
We just took up the National Defense Authorization Act. We used that process. It worked. That bill passed the Senate by an overwhelming number. We considered many amendments. By the way, every amendment was considered by a majority vote. That is how this should work. Majority rules should rule on the floor of the Senate. I agree with all of that.
The first order is to be able to bring bills to the floor in a more efficient way. The second problem we have, quite frankly, is that the Republicans have blocked the ability to orderly consider the nominations of the President, whether they are his Cabinet or subcabinet positions or whether they are the article III judges. In many cases, once we get to the nomination it passes by an overwhelming majority. I can't tell you how many nominations have been approved basically by voice vote in the Judiciary Committee that have had to wait months for consideration on the floor of the Senate. In my State of Maryland we had several nominees, not controversial at all, who had to wait month after month for confirmation before they could sit as a district court judge.
First of all, it is unconscionable to make people wait when we need to have judicial positions filled. Secondly, it is affecting us getting the very best people to step forward to serve, because do they really want to go through that type of uncertainty, not even clear whether the Senate will act on their nomination before it adjourns? So the second issue is we have to act on nominations in a more efficient way.
The third--and I agree with my colleagues here. Ultimately, the majority of this body should be able to move legislation. And at a minimum, I agree, if you are using an extraordinary measure as a minority to block legislation, you should be on the floor of the Senate speaking on that issue. Your responsibility should be to talk. If you are using a filibuster, you should be there engaged in that filibuster.
I think these are reasonable reforms that we should try to move forward. This body operates on a lot of unanimous consents; we move a lot of legislation. We have what is known as the hot line, where at the end of the day we try to clear bills and then the leader brings them to the floor for consent or voice vote. At times there are Members who put a hold on a bill, and we have had Members who put holds on hundreds of bills. They should come to the floor to object. In many cases these are not broad bills. These are bills that affect perhaps land in New Mexico or establishing a national park in Maryland that have gone through the whole committee process and we have worked out all the cost issues so there is no cost involved. They have passed the committee by overwhelming majority votes--in most cases unanimous votes. But now you need to move them forward so we put them on the hot line, and we don't even in some cases know who is objecting. The Senator who objects should come to the floor of the Senate and object and give a reason. I know we got rid of the so-called secret holds, but they still exist today. We should operate with Members being here on the floor conducting business, not in their office either in the Capitol or in their home States. They should be here on the floor of the Senate if they intend to exercise their right to object, and then give us an opportunity to work that out so we could move legislation more efficiently.
The bottom line, what we need to do, is make this system work more efficiently. This is the greatest deliberative body in the world. We should be debating issues. That means bringing bills to the floor in a more timely way, getting on amendments in a faster way, voting and debating issues for the American people.
I applaud the Senators from New Mexico and Oregon. They have taken the leadership on bringing this to the attention of the American people. I think for too long a period of time Americans didn't focus on this issue.
Well, they are focused on it today. They understand that a lot of the bills they wanted to see passed in the 112th Congress didn't get passed and they want to know why we didn't even debate those issues.
Let us reform our rules and procedures on the floor of the Senate to reflect the best traditions of the Senate. That is what the Senator from Oregon, the Senator from New Mexico, and others are trying to do.
The Senator from Alabama talked about restoring the traditions of the Senate. I hope we can do it in a bipartisan manner. That is the way it should be done. We should come together to preserve the institution. It should work whether the Democrats are in the majority or the Republicans are in the majority. The same rules should work. Whether we are in the majority or minority, we should believe that we should come to the floor of the Senate to debate the issues that are important to our constituents.
I thank again my friend from New Mexico for allowing me to engage in this colloquy with him. I applaud him again for standing up on this issue. I know it has been difficult at times when many people come over and say, Why are you trying to change the traditions of the Senate? The truth is we are not trying to change the traditions of the Senate. We are trying to restore the Senate to the type of body it should be. I don't think there is a single Member of the Senate who believes that we conducted business in the best traditions of the Senate during these past 2 years, and that has been because we have seen the abuses of individual Senators holding up bills and not being able to debate issues. We have to overcome that. I think we have a chance to do that at the beginning of the 113th Congress, which will start in less than 24 hours from now. I am pleased that the three of us will all be in the Senate in the 113th Congress, and I hope we will have a chance to resolve these issues because I think it is critically important for the people we represent in our respective States and in the country.",MD,CARDIN,-0.463,D,mr presid thank senat udal take time commit institut oper correctli thank senat merkley leadership agre senat go engag extraordinari action filibust floor talk make sens senat session conduct busi shouldnt go extens quorum call singl senat object us proceed want get back tradit senat becom greatest delib bodi world debat issu resolv issu act issu listen distinguish senat alabama point believ senat work way debat amend think debat amend think key need need chang way senat act oper recent time mean need get legisl quickli actual debat bill committe abl report legisl could act floor senat got bring issu conclus two problem see one individu senat use right object unanim consent delay almost indefinitelyin case killinglegisl abl move forward singl object lot time even floor senat make object leader say dont want bill move forward mayb ye let move forward let us 50 amend kill bill seen individu senat exercis right object brought legisl standstil floor senat wrong distinguish colleagu senat new mexico point major leader file record number clotur end debat minor parti whatev reason allow us proceed legisl debat normal major parti right determin agenda senat dont right pass bill major senat major leader right bring bill floor senat deni minor parti wrong agre friend alabama right offer amend think debat issu agre hasnt problem problem certain number member use right object work republican leader block us consid lot bill floor senat need need abl first move legisl forward need abl bring bill committe floor debat get amend process took nation defens author act use process work bill pass senat overwhelm number consid mani amend way everi amend consid major vote work major rule rule floor senat agre first order abl bring bill floor effici way second problem quit frankli republican block abil orderli consid nomin presid whether cabinet subcabinet posit whether articl iii judg mani case get nomin pass overwhelm major cant tell mani nomin approv basic voic vote judiciari committe wait month consider floor senat state maryland sever nomine controversi wait month month confirm could sit district court judg first unconscion make peopl wait need judici posit fill secondli affect us get best peopl step forward serv realli want go type uncertainti even clear whether senat act nomin adjourn second issu act nomin effici way thirdand agre colleagu ultim major bodi abl move legisl minimum agre use extraordinari measur minor block legisl floor senat speak issu respons talk use filibust engag filibust think reason reform tri move forward bodi oper lot unanim consent move lot legisl known hot line end day tri clear bill leader bring floor consent voic vote time member put hold bill member put hold hundr bill come floor object mani case broad bill bill affect perhap land new mexico establish nation park maryland gone whole committe process work cost issu cost involv pass committe overwhelm major votesin case unanim vote need move forward put hot line dont even case know object senat object come floor senat object give reason know got rid socal secret hold still exist today oper member floor conduct busi offic either capitol home state floor senat intend exercis right object give us opportun work could move legisl effici bottom line need make system work effici greatest delib bodi world debat issu mean bring bill floor time way get amend faster way vote debat issu american peopl applaud senat new mexico oregon taken leadership bring attent american peopl think long period time american didnt focu issu well focus today understand lot bill want see pass 112th congress didnt get pass want know didnt even debat issu let us reform rule procedur floor senat reflect best tradit senat senat oregon senat new mexico other tri senat alabama talk restor tradit senat hope bipartisan manner way done come togeth preserv institut work whether democrat major republican major rule work whether major minor believ come floor senat debat issu import constitu thank friend new mexico allow engag colloquy applaud stand issu know difficult time mani peopl come say tri chang tradit senat truth tri chang tradit senat tri restor senat type bodi dont think singl member senat believ conduct busi best tradit senat past 2 year seen abus individu senat hold bill abl debat issu overcom think chanc begin 113th congress start less 24 hour pleas three us senat 113th congress hope chanc resolv issu think critic import peopl repres respect state countri
110,NM.UDALL,NM,Udall,"The Senator from Maryland hit on a couple of incredibly important points here, and I hope he has a minute or two to further engage in a colloquy.
First of all, we shouldn't be saying all the credit goes to me or to the Senator from Oregon. Senator Cardin, the Senator from Maryland, participated very actively 2 years ago in the key group of Senators who were trying to understand what the rules were all about, why the Senate wasn't functioning, and how do we get to the point of drafting a package and working out a package to make it happen. I congratulate him for that.
I want to also congratulate the Senators who have worked on this from about 2006 on. Those Senators have come in and they have seen the Senate not be the way it should, not maintaining those traditions of debate and discussion, and then finally, at the end of the day, acting on those important problems.
The Senator from Maryland knows that history. I appreciate exactly what he said. It should be bipartisan. As he knows, what frequently happens around here is that when you get close to having 51 votes--which we have today, we have 51 votes, and the majority leader has 51 votes to be able to walk down here and say: These are the rules we want, and to do it. When the reality sets in on the Senate that we have 51 votes, then people start thinking, how do we want to put this together?
A bipartisan tradition is important. We have--the Senators from Oregon, Maryland, myself--we have all invited our Republican friends and colleagues forward, saying: Engage with us to get back to the point where this Senate can operate in a bipartisan way with respect to the rules and with respect to the substantive legislation.
What I want to ask the Senator from Maryland has to do with the President's team. We only have one President at a time. We have Barack Obama in as President. He was reelected. He still has people from this Congress--a large number of judges, of nominees--who are held up for months and months. Does the Senator from Maryland believe that the nomination process is broken, that we need to move forward, to find a way so we can get up-or-down votes on some of these nominations, whether they be judicial, whether they be people who are going to serve in these Cabinet agencies?",NM,UDALL,-0.431,D,senat maryland hit coupl incred import point hope minut two engag colloquy first shouldnt say credit goe senat oregon senat cardin senat maryland particip activ 2 year ago key group senat tri understand rule senat wasnt function get point draft packag work packag make happen congratul want also congratul senat work 2006 senat come seen senat way maintain tradit debat discuss final end day act import problem senat maryland know histori appreci exactli said bipartisan know frequent happen around get close 51 voteswhich today 51 vote major leader 51 vote abl walk say rule want realiti set senat 51 vote peopl start think want put togeth bipartisan tradit import haveth senat oregon maryland myselfw invit republican friend colleagu forward say engag us get back point senat oper bipartisan way respect rule respect substant legisl want ask senat maryland presid team one presid time barack obama presid reelect still peopl congressa larg number judg nomineeswho held month month senat maryland believ nomin process broken need move forward find way get upordown vote nomin whether judici whether peopl go serv cabinet agenc
111,MD.CARDIN,MD,Cardin,"I thank the Senator for raising the issue. Let me tell people what happens all too frequently in this body. The President will nominate a person to be at a Cabinet-level or sub-Cabinet-level position that requires confirmation of the Senate. Individual Senators say: I have a problem. Maybe it is the person in the health department. I have some problems in the health department that I would like to see paid attention to. It has nothing at all to do with the nominee. In fact, getting a confirmed person in that position would be very important to getting those issues resolved. The Senator uses what is known as the courtesy of a hold to hold up that position in order to try to get changes made in that agency. That may take a week. That may take a month. That may never be resolved. In the meantime, we are not acting on many of the positions that require confirmation from the Senate.
I think we are down to about 500 positions now that require Senate confirmation. We streamlined that in the last Congress. We eliminated some that required the confirmation of the Senate. That was a good change we made 2 years ago. That worked. We now have somewhere around I think 500 or 600 positions that require Senate confirmation.
Let me give a little arithmetic here. If the majority leader has to bring a cloture motion in order to break an individual hold of a Senator on those 500 nominees, the Senate will do nothing but nominations. We will not be able to do any other business because, as you know, it could take up to 30 hours of postcloture time to consider just one nominee. So under the current rules of the Senate, if one Senator wants to stop the confirmation process, that Senator can basically stop it and bring it to a halt. That has happened. We have seen that happen too frequently.
One of the suggestions that has been made is that when we have these confirmations that have been approved by the committee, allow us to bring them to the floor and certainly eliminate or restrict the postcloture time because it is not used other than for a delay purpose. In that way, we can bring forward nominations more efficiently. If there is a serious problem, let a Senator register the problem. Let a Senator come to the floor and speak about the person. But we have not had discussions on the floor.
It is interesting--when we finally break that hold and the nomination comes forward, we finally get a cloture motion passed, the debate time is virtually zero. There is no debate time needed for these. It is not as though Senators are delaying it because they need debate time. These are strictly dilatory actions. 
For the sake of any administration, whether it is a Republican administration or Democratic administration, whether it is the first term or second term, that President should be able to get his or her team in place. Yes, we should take seriously the advice and consent of the Senate. That means we should vote on those nominees. If there is a serious concern, let's vote on it, and if we want to filibuster it, be on the floor debating why.
We think the minority has a responsibility--or in some cases it could be a minority within the majority--to argue why we believe it is important to bring this matter to the attention of the American people. But don't continue the practice that has been used in recent times where nominations are delayed months and sometimes indefinitely because of basically unrelated issues or the will of the minority or a number of Senators--in some cases, just a handful. That should not happen. We should be able to do these more efficiently.
We have a recommendation for this, and it is very simple: Let's eliminate the postcloture time. That way, we would be able to bring the nominations to the floor and act on them in a much more timely way if there is really an issue about getting a vote on a nominee. There are ways we could do that, but it should be part of the reforms of the 113th Congress.
I thank Senator Udall for bringing up that issue. That is a very important issue for any administration, whether it is a Republican or Democratic administration. It is hard to hold an administration accountable if they do not have the confirmed top leaders of their team.",MD,CARDIN,-0.463,D,thank senat rais issu let tell peopl happen frequent bodi presid nomin person cabinetlevel subcabinetlevel posit requir confirm senat individu senat say problem mayb person health depart problem health depart would like see paid attent noth nomine fact get confirm person posit would import get issu resolv senat use known courtesi hold hold posit order tri get chang made agenc may take week may take month may never resolv meantim act mani posit requir confirm senat think 500 posit requir senat confirm streamlin last congress elimin requir confirm senat good chang made 2 year ago work somewher around think 500 600 posit requir senat confirm let give littl arithmet major leader bring clotur motion order break individu hold senat 500 nomine senat noth nomin abl busi know could take 30 hour postclotur time consid one nomine current rule senat one senat want stop confirm process senat basic stop bring halt happen seen happen frequent one suggest made confirm approv committe allow us bring floor certainli elimin restrict postclotur time use delay purpos way bring forward nomin effici seriou problem let senat regist problem let senat come floor speak person discuss floor interestingwhen final break hold nomin come forward final get clotur motion pass debat time virtual zero debat time need though senat delay need debat time strictli dilatori action sake administr whether republican administr democrat administr whether first term second term presid abl get team place ye take serious advic consent senat mean vote nomine seriou concern let vote want filibust floor debat think minor responsibilityor case could minor within majorityto argu believ import bring matter attent american peopl dont continu practic use recent time nomin delay month sometim indefinit basic unrel issu minor number senatorsin case hand happen abl effici recommend simpl let elimin postclotur time way would abl bring nomin floor act much time way realli issu get vote nomine way could part reform 113th congress thank senat udal bring issu import issu administr whether republican democrat administr hard hold administr account confirm top leader team
112,NM.UDALL,NM,Udall,"The Senator from Maryland has really hit it on the head. You do not have to go any further than today's Executive Calendar. We all have them on our desks. You pick up the Executive Calendar and, talking about approving these nominees and judicial nominees, executive nominees, here I see on page 4 that we have people who have come out--this is for the judiciary--have come out of committee March 29, and they have not gotten a vote. Here is another one from April, reported by the committee--April 26, May 17, May 17, June 7, June 21. These are nominations where people have stepped forward. They want to be public servants. The President has nominated them. They have been through the committee process, and they are just waiting.
As the Senator from Maryland said, what ends up happening is that good people are discouraged from taking these jobs. My grandfather used to say that if you do not have good people in government, the scoundrels will take over. We are discouraging good people from getting into government. You need good people in public service, and we are discouraging them by setting up a process where, as the Senator from Ohio told me--he had a judge recently, and he told the gentleman: This is a long process, it is laborious, it is tedious, and it will probably take you a year if you are willing to go through this. When the judge finally agreed, it took 2 years from the time the President put him forward until he was actually on the bench.
I ask the Senator from Maryland, does he think people are going to put themselves out there, and doesn't this discourage good people from getting into public service?

113,MD.CARDIN,MD,Cardin,"I can tell my friend from New Mexico, that is happening today. I have talked to people in Maryland who are very reluctant to put their names forward because they do not want to put their families and themselves through the uncertainty.
Let me tell you what happens. Let's say you are a distinguished attorney in a law firm and we would love to get you as an article III judge, so we convince you. You are the most distinguished person for this job, the person everybody wants, not partisan at all, no controversy. The Bar Association will give you the highest ratings. You have already been vetted through the FBI process. There is nothing in your background that would raise a concern with anyone. But you look at the calendar here and say: If I go through this, I am going to be on this calendar for at least 6 months, it looks like. What does that do to my law firm? Can I try cases? What do I do for the next 6 months? It is not fair to me, it is not fair to my law firm, and it is not fair to my family. So you are not going to put yourself forward.
Let me tell my colleagues about another problem. In many of these circuits where these judges are sitting--these nominees are waiting month after month, and we have judicial emergencies. We have a chronic problem of moving cases in these circuits, where the administrators of the courts--these are independent branches of government--tell us they cannot do their job because they do not have the manpower to do it. And we are holding up confirmations not because of any substantive reason but because of the process or because of one person in the Senate who, for reasons unrelated to that individual, is holding up all of these nominations. That is not right. We are denying our country the very best, who cannot step forward under this type of circumstance, and in many cases we are denying justice in our circuits because we do not have people in place to be able to timely resolve rule-of-law issues, which is the basis of our system here in America.
It is a very serious situation. We need to resolve how we handle the Article III confirmation process in the next Congress, which starts again in less than 24 hours, as well as the individuals whom we want on the boards who need confirmation--the sub-Cabinet and Cabinet positions.
The same thing is true of Cabinet positions. If you are an expert in securities issues and we want to get you on the Securities and Exchange Commission and you have to be out there for 6 months, what is it going to do for your business? Can you do your profession?
It is just not right. I think people are willing to be subjected to the scrutiny of advice and consent. They understand that. What they do not understand is dilatory delay, and that is what has to come to an end.

116,NM.UDALL,NM,Udall,"The Senator from Maryland has hit it on the head. Look at what we are talking about on a motion to proceed. I think it would surprise the American people to know that if the majority leader comes to the floor, now we have--this is not to make it partisan in any way--55 Democratic votes. The majority leader says: I see we have a serious housing problem. We want to put a housing bill onto the floor of the Senate.
I don't think people realize that the majority leader, if he doesn't have any agreement at all, then has to file a motion to proceed to that bill. If all the delay and roadblocks and obfuscation are put in front of him, it takes him 8 days to get to the bill if he can get 60 votes. If he does not, he probably wastes a whole week trying to get to the bill, and he doesn't get 60 votes, and then we fold it down and say: What is the next issue we should move on to? 
As the Senator from Maryland knows, we have to be able to put bills onto the floor and give them the time they deserve. We are wasting all this time up front that we could have a bill on the floor, we could have amendments, we could have debate, we could have all of those things going on that we know are the way the Senate should work.

117,MD.CARDIN,MD,Cardin,"Under current policy, the motion to proceed has to be approved before anyone can offer any amendments. My friend from Alabama is talking about amendments. We cannot offer any amendments until we get the bill to the floor. So the majority leader is trying to bring up this bill to deal with housing because we have a housing crisis. It came out of the committee, everybody was ready to move on it, but he cannot get the motion to proceed approved. Now we are literally in no-man's land. We cannot offer amendments and cannot proceed on it.
The majority leader has one of two choices: He could wait for us to reach an agreement--if we ever reach an agreement--or file cloture. He should not have to do that. He should be able to offer the bill and offer amendments and get started. We cannot do that. We have to approve the motion to proceed first. So the majority leader tries to condense the clock. People complain that we are not getting work done, so he files cloture on the motion to proceed. As a result, we have to waste one full legislative day before we can get through to the vote on the cloture. If we get to the vote on the cloture--this is on the motion to proceed. This does not deny the right of any Member to offer any amendments, whether germane or not germane.
Let's say the majority wants to approve the motion to proceed and get 60 votes on the cloture--and, remember, this is the third legislative day. Let's say it is approved 95 to 1, because there was one objection. That's why we could not get the motion to proceed done. Now we are on the third legislative day and we have 30 hours of postcloture time. Another 2 days go by, and we are now on the bill, but we cannot debate the bill. We have not even started the amendments.
My friend from Alabama is saying he wants to deal with amendments. Well, I want to deal with amendments. Why do we have to waste all those days to get to the bill? That makes no sense at all. A lot of us think we should be able to bring up a motion to proceed. We have some recommendations on how we can expedite that and guarantee some amendments as part of the process. That is all part of what we have all been working on: How can we get the Senate back to its traditional way of considering legislation in a fair manner and making decisions?
At the end of the day, this is a democracy and the majority should be able to control the policy of this body. At the end of the day, it should be able to do that. Certainly those who object should be on the floor telling why they are objecting. I think that is what we are trying to do. We are trying to get this process to work in a fair manner, and I understand we have to protect the rights of the minority.
My friend from Alabama raised a very good point. There are no guarantees of how long one party will be in the majority. We understand that. The political whim of Americans changes over time, political preferences change over time, and we have to make sure that the rules we operate under protect both the majority and the minority. That is absolutely important.
The Senate is a deliberative body, and we want to make sure that all rights are protected, including the minority. However, what is wrong is when one, two, or a small group of Senators can basically bring this institution to a halt. They have done that over the last couple of years at a time when we could have done more business. I think starting tomorrow we have a chance to change some of those procedures. I hope we will be able to get that done.
Senator Udall has really brought these issues to light--whether it is the motion to proceed so we can start debate or whether it is how we can dispose of amendments, handle a filibuster, deal with court and other nominations, these are all important issues. How we deal with what we call comity, or respect of Senators, how Senators deal with objections, how they should be on the floor of the Senate to raise those objections, and how objections are done.
When a committee is considering a bill on the floor and the managers are considering that legislation--they have an orderly way to consider the amendments--and all of a sudden we hear one Senator objects and stops us from moving forward on amendments--well, that should not take place. If the Senator is going to object, have the Senator on the floor saying why he or she is objecting. Don't do it by saying we can stop consideration of the bill and go into a quorum call and lose all that valuable time.
I think there are some commonsense changes. I do hope we can get Democrats and Republicans joining together for these reforms. Whether Democrats or Republicans are in the majority, that is how the rules should work to protect all the Members of this institution.",MD,CARDIN,-0.463,D,current polici motion proceed approv anyon offer amend friend alabama talk amend cannot offer amend get bill floor major leader tri bring bill deal hous hous crisi came committe everybodi readi move cannot get motion proceed approv liter noman land cannot offer amend cannot proceed major leader one two choic could wait us reach agreementif ever reach agreementor file clotur abl offer bill offer amend get start cannot approv motion proceed first major leader tri condens clock peopl complain get work done file clotur motion proceed result wast one full legisl day get vote clotur get vote cloturethi motion proceed deni right member offer amend whether german german let say major want approv motion proceed get 60 vote clotureand rememb third legisl day let say approv 95 1 one object that could get motion proceed done third legisl day 30 hour postclotur time anoth 2 day go bill cannot debat bill even start amend friend alabama say want deal amend well want deal amend wast day get bill make sens lot us think abl bring motion proceed recommend expedit guarante amend part process part work get senat back tradit way consid legisl fair manner make decis end day democraci major abl control polici bodi end day abl certainli object floor tell object think tri tri get process work fair manner understand protect right minor friend alabama rais good point guarante long one parti major understand polit whim american chang time polit prefer chang time make sure rule oper protect major minor absolut import senat delib bodi want make sure right protect includ minor howev wrong one two small group senat basic bring institut halt done last coupl year time could done busi think start tomorrow chanc chang procedur hope abl get done senat udal realli brought issu lightwheth motion proceed start debat whether dispos amend handl filibust deal court nomin import issu deal call comiti respect senat senat deal object floor senat rais object object done committe consid bill floor manag consid legislationthey orderli way consid amendmentsand sudden hear one senat object stop us move forward amendmentswel take place senat go object senat floor say object dont say stop consider bill go quorum call lose valuabl time think commonsens chang hope get democrat republican join togeth reform whether democrat republican major rule work protect member institut
118,NM.UDALL,NM,Udall,"To the Senator from Maryland, I have one more question if he has time. First I want to respond as to the motion to proceed and what he has just talked about. This means we cannot get on legislation, as he laid out, for a large number of days. Sometimes we burn a week and several more days before we are able to get on to the bill.
The Senator by the name of Senator Pete Domenici, whom everybody knows very well, served for 36 years in the Senate and was my predecessor. He served on bipartisan study groups to look at the rules. We have had many study groups such as that. They have always concluded that the motion to proceed should be short and significant, and we should get on to the bill.
Senator Cardin has worked very hard to do the same with a bipartisan group to say: How can we make it work better? How do we make this institution work better? The reality is we get on to the bill, allow amendments, allow debate, and allow discussion. That is the way to move. On a number of occasions this has been bipartisan. I hope we can join together.
My question goes to a different part of the rules. As the Senator from Maryland knows--and we both served in the House together--today we have a Democratic Senate and a Republican House. The way to resolve differences between the two is to go to conference. That is the best way to bring the expertise of both bodies and the people in the bodies who know the substance of the legislation and bring them together if there are differences. If they both pass a bill, they get together, resolve those differences and then the respective Houses pass them and they go on to the President.
We now have in our rules for the Senate three debatable, filibusterable motions to go to conference. We look at them and we say: Well, they are basically about going to conference. Let's shrink down the proposals we are hearing. Why are we putting a filibuster in place to get into conference to try to resolve disputes?
I know the Senator has looked at this issue. My question is: If the Senate is able to pass a bill on housing--to use the housing example--and they are very different bills, but if we have smart people from the Senate and the House who are on the Housing Committee getting together--as the Senator from Maryland knows--we can resolve those differences. We can find the common ground and move forward.
I ask the Senator: Aren't our rules a little bit antiquated in terms of having three motions to go to conference and allow a filibuster on every one of those rules?",NM,UDALL,-0.431,D,senat maryland one question time first want respond motion proceed talk mean cannot get legisl laid larg number day sometim burn week sever day abl get bill senat name senat pete domenici everybodi know well serv 36 year senat predecessor serv bipartisan studi group look rule mani studi group alway conclud motion proceed short signific get bill senat cardin work hard bipartisan group say make work better make institut work better realiti get bill allow amend allow debat allow discuss way move number occas bipartisan hope join togeth question goe differ part rule senat maryland knowsand serv hous togethertoday democrat senat republican hous way resolv differ two go confer best way bring expertis bodi peopl bodi know substanc legisl bring togeth differ pass bill get togeth resolv differ respect hous pass go presid rule senat three debat filibuster motion go confer look say well basic go confer let shrink propos hear put filibust place get confer tri resolv disput know senat look issu question senat abl pass bill housingto use hous exampleand differ bill smart peopl senat hous hous committe get togethera senat maryland knowsw resolv differ find common ground move forward ask senat arent rule littl bit antiqu term three motion go confer allow filibust everi one rule
119,MD.CARDIN,MD,Cardin,"The Senator is absolutely right. I think when those rules were promulgated, the view was they would be done routinely and that there would never be a challenge to the action taken. The action is going to conference, appointing conferees, and instructing the conference. The Senator is absolutely right, they are all the same. It is getting us into conference where the House and Senate Members can be together, resolve their differences, and report a common bill back to both bodies. That is the whole purpose of a conference committee.
I think it is particularly important today that when we have the House controlled by Republicans and the Senate controlled by Democrats, we should use regular order. We should meet with our Republican-controlled delegations with the Senate and try to resolve our differences in an open and transparent way that the rules apply.
Under the current rules, since each one of those is a separate action--as Senator Udall pointed out--we can object to it being routinely approved. At that point, under the current rules, we can force--this is all precloture--a cloture motion being filed on each one of those three separate actions.
I already went over how much time it takes for a cloture motion to ripen. Let's assume we can get over that hurdle--which we cannot--each one of those cloture votes, even though they may be 99 to 1, will have 30 hours of postcloture. If we start to add it up, we are going to lose over a full week just to get into cloture, which obviously means we cannot get it to conference. We cannot use the deliberative process to resolve our differences and we cannot use the Senate unless we have unanimous consent, basically, and that is wrong.
So we do have a recommendation, and I am pleased the Senator pointed out that we are working with Republicans. We have had a group of Democrats and Republicans working together to try to resolve some of these differences, and I think there is general agreement to collapse those three motions into one motion so that at least we can eliminate the extra two votes and potential cloture votes and postcloture time which would be required. I think that is a relatively easy change for us to make. I don't know of anyone who objects to that. I have not heard of anyone who objects to that. I hope we could get that done.
When we start looking at where we could change the procedures and where we hope we could get bipartisan support, I think going to conference is one area on which we could get bipartisan support.
I agree with the Senator in that I have not heard of anyone who believes the motion to proceed has been used in the proper way. I think we can find a way to condense that. I hope we can. There have been some bipartisan recommendations to have orderly ways in which we could go to the motion to proceed immediately by certain guaranteed amendments or where the two leaders have agreed to go to a bill, so I think we could do that.
I think there has also been some agreement on the nomination to shorten the time so we can move that along. I think we have both Democrats and Republicans who are in agreement with that. I hope we can figure out a better way so we don't have to file all these cloture motions and waste a lot of time and those who object on the floor with the burden to debate the issue--I think that is the important reform that needs to be done.",MD,CARDIN,-0.463,D,senat absolut right think rule promulg view would done routin would never challeng action taken action go confer appoint confere instruct confer senat absolut right get us confer hous senat member togeth resolv differ report common bill back bodi whole purpos confer committe think particularli import today hous control republican senat control democrat use regular order meet republicancontrol deleg senat tri resolv differ open transpar way rule appli current rule sinc one separ actiona senat udal point outw object routin approv point current rule forcethi precloturea clotur motion file one three separ action alreadi went much time take clotur motion ripen let assum get hurdlewhich cannoteach one clotur vote even though may 99 1 30 hour postclotur start add go lose full week get clotur obvious mean cannot get confer cannot use delib process resolv differ cannot use senat unless unanim consent basic wrong recommend pleas senat point work republican group democrat republican work togeth tri resolv differ think gener agreement collaps three motion one motion least elimin extra two vote potenti clotur vote postclotur time would requir think rel easi chang us make dont know anyon object heard anyon object hope could get done start look could chang procedur hope could get bipartisan support think go confer one area could get bipartisan support agre senat heard anyon believ motion proceed use proper way think find way condens hope bipartisan recommend orderli way could go motion proceed immedi certain guarante amend two leader agre go bill think could think also agreement nomin shorten time move along think democrat republican agreement hope figur better way dont file clotur motion wast lot time object floor burden debat issuei think import reform need done

121,MD.CARDIN,MD,Cardin,"I probably am in a position that most of the Members of this body are not in. I have served on one conference committee--I have been here 6 years--and it was a successful conference committee. It dealt with the payroll tax extensions and some of the other changes. I was able to serve on that and we were able to reach a conference agreement and we were able to get our work done in a timely way. We got it done early by Senate standards and the legislative standards. I am trying to think if there were any other conferences that were reported back. I think we had one maybe on aviation that was reported back. I don't think there were more than a handful of conferences that have met in the last several congresses. There were maybe a couple each Congress. Think about how many bills were between the House and the Senate. It is a rarity. It is virtually not used. Interestingly enough, when it is used, we generally get better results, earlier results, and more open results.
I appreciate the Senator mentioning serving in the State legislature. I am a former speaker of the State legislature. I think we get better laws when we use the legislative process and have a more open process where the committees work and bring the bills to the floor, actually debate them and amend them on the floor of the Senate. That way when there are differences between the House and the Senate, they are worked out by the Members. They actually meet and work out their differences.
We are the ones who are accountable for the legislative process. It should not be some supercommittee or bargaining units that are set up by the President and the Congress. They should not be the ones. It should be the legislators who make these decisions, and that is why I think it is so important to get the committees functioning, get the floor of the Senate functioning, and get the conference committees functioning. I think if we can do that, we are going to get better laws, laws that make more sense, better understood, and that will stand the test of time. That is what I think all of us are trying to do.
We seek these jobs because we believe in our system. We believe in the richness of an independent legislature where we are held accountable for the work we have done. Quite frankly, it is difficult for us to get our work done in an accountable way if we don't have an open and transparent system.

123,MD.CARDIN,MD,Cardin,"The Senator from New Mexico has been the one who has brought this to us, and I know he has included others and certainly Senator Merkley has been in the forefront of this. The Senator from New Mexico has taken a real leadership role and he has done it in an open way. We want this done with Democrats and Republicans working together because we recognize the system only works when Democrats and Republicans can come together. That is why he has taken the time today on the floor of the Senate, and he has been very open about this issue. He has taken it to a lot of groups explaining the impact.
People ask us all the time: Why can't we do more to help the environment? Why can't we do more to help working families? Why can't we do more for affordable housing? Why can't we do more for affordable health care?
We say: We can't get that bill to the floor of the Senate.
They say: What are you talking about? You are a Senator. Bring it up on the floor of the Senate.
We heard Senator Sessions say the Senate can offer an amendment at any time. Just try.
We want the system to work. Whether a person is a Democrat or a Republican, we want the system to work. That is why we are taking this time today, at the end of the 112th Congress, to say: Look, what happens on Senate rules and procedures affects every person in this country.
I have talked to so many people who have come into my office with individual concerns, including families who are worried if their children will get the type of attention they need if perhaps they have a disability and they are working on a bill that will help, and they have all these cosponsors of the bill and they hear the committee reported it favorably and they are wondering why we can't act on it on the floor of the Senate. That is what is at stake. We can say to them: Oh, I am a cosponsor of that bill. I voted for that bill, but the bill didn't become law because of the process we have now.
That is what we have to correct. That is going to be our responsibility starting tomorrow, at noon, to deal with rules and procedures so we are in a position during the next 2 years to end the gridlock that has happened on too many issues. Yes, the public understood somewhat the gridlock on the fiscal cliff. They don't understand the gridlock on that bill that affected that family with a child with a disability. They don't understand why that bill couldn't make it to the floor of the Senate. We understand that. What the Senator from New Mexico is doing is taking action so we can be held accountable and do our work in the most efficient way. I am proud to join him in these efforts and I urge all my colleagues to do everything we can in the next 24 hours so we can get progress made.

124,NM.UDALL,NM,Udall,"I thank the Senator from Maryland for his sincere effort to pursue bipartisan rules reform because I think, if we all work together, we can make the Senate a much better place.
I am reminded, when we have these discussions about the great traditions of the Senate, of two periods of time when the Senate truly stepped to the plate. We had crucial national issues facing us then and they were issues of war and peace. They were issues of terrible environmental destruction. The fact is the Senate, in its best traditions, stepped forward and acted and moved forward. One of those great traditions of the Senate acting occurred in the 40 years before the Civil War. People may not know it, but it was the Senate and the legislation that was passed through the Senate and signed by the President that for 40 years held the Union together. They held the country together, and they didn't let the country get into Civil War. It was people such as Webster and Calhoun and all the Senators at the time focusing on what the issues were. Whether it was the Missouri Compromise or some other issue that had to do with slavery, they found the common ground, and they held the Union together and they did it for 40 years.
That, my friends, is in the best traditions of the Senate, thinking and figuring out where the common ground is. We can't do that. We can't carry out that tradition unless we can get bills on the floor and we can amend them and have debate and then eventually get to a majority. Of course, we want the minority to be able to be heard, offer amendments, but the crucial fact is, at the end of the day, unless there is such a strong minority in terms of its activity, we get to a majority vote.
The other period of time where the Senate was in its glory days was in the 1960s and 1970s and we had huge national problems in terms of civil rights. We had lynchings going on, we had discrimination going on, including housing discrimination, discrimination in public accommodations, and there was a big push to try to get rid of that in our society. It was the Senate that stepped forward and crafted civil rights legislation that allowed us to move forward.
Many people will remember in the 1970s, the glory days of the Senate, when we had environmental destruction, rivers catching on fire. The Wilderness Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, all those pieces of legislation were crafted in the Senate by people such as Senator Ed Muskie and Senator Stafford and others. They were Democrats and Republicans working with each other, but it was because we could get the legislation on the floor and work on it and amend it and move it forward and allow the deliberative process to work.
I submit the Senate has been at these two periods--and I am sure scholars and our Senate Historian and others can point out other periods--but these two periods struck me: the period of the 40 years before the Civil War when the Senate, in its deliberative way, held the Union together for 40 years and in the 1960s and 1970s when we addressed civil rights, environmental legislation, and many of the other big national issues we were facing.
So here we are as a country with the need for having a national energy policy, for dealing with issues such as climate change, protecting middle-class families, and trying to make sure we have job growth and economic development; doing everything we can to bring down the cost of health care but making sure our citizens have high-quality health care.
We face tremendous issues, and the Senate, in many cases, has been unable to act. We have been unable to act because the rules are being abused. This filibuster is not out in the open. It is secret, it is silent, and we have the opportunity to act on the first legislative day.
So on that first legislative day, I will offer a motion. It is a very simple motion my predecessor, Clinton Anderson, offered. He offered it for the 25 years he was in the Senate. On the first legislative day he would offer a motion. He would move to adopt the rules of the Congress--for him, whatever it was. So this motion dealing with tomorrow: move to adopt the rules for the 113th Congress and then we focus on it. We focus on what those rules should be.

127,IL.DURBIN,IL,Durbin,"I thank the Senator from New Mexico and the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Oregon, for their leadership in talking about rules reform. They are relatively new to the Senate. I have been here a few years and I have seen a dramatic change, and it is not for the better.
I can recall when I came here fresh from the House of Representatives, as the Senator from New Mexico did, and I had my first amendment on the floor. A lady named Lula, who was the floor manager on the Democratic side, came up to help me, this brandnew freshman, with this first amendment. She said to me: So let me explain that you have 1 hour and then the Senator on the Republican side will have 1 hour.
I said: Well, is that equally divided?
She said: No, you have an hour.
To say to a Member of the House ``you have an hour'' is just unthinkable. You get an hour for a special order at 11 o'clock at night; otherwise, 60 seconds is considered to be a luxury in the House. I didn't know what to do with an hour and I certainly didn't use it all. But it is an example of a time when amendments came to the floor with real debate, and there was a Senator from South Carolina who opposed my amendment on the floor as well.
I can also remember coming to the floor and offering amendments literally on the spur of the moment on something I thought was worthy. I didn't always win, but that wasn't the point. I wanted to have debate and then a vote and it happened. Now that is almost unheard of. We go through these vote-athons, where we have these long series of amendments with 60 seconds of debate before the vote. It troubles me because that isn't what the Senate is supposed to be about.
I had a friend of mine in the House--the Senator from New Mexico probably heard of him--Mike Synar of Oklahoma. Mike Synar used to listen to Members of the House of Representatives whining and crying about the controversial amendments they were forced to vote on. Mike Synar, who was rather candid in his comments, said: If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a firefighter. If you don't want to vote on controversial amendments, don't run for the House of Representatives. That is what we are here for.
I tend to take the same point of view, maybe because after a few years a Senator votes on everything at least once.
But we have to get back to where we aren't just lurching, as we are now, from one quorum call to another, an empty Senate Chamber, waiting for something to happen. There is a lot out there for us to talk about, and we should. I think the American people would feel a little better about us if we sat down and at least honestly debated an issue and voted with some frequency.
What we are trying to do now is to stop what I consider to be the gross abuse of the filibuster. What we have been through here has destroyed the functionality of the Senate. To think any person can come to the floor and basically bring this place to a halt not just for an hour or a day but maybe 1 week, that goes way beyond what I believe was the intent of creating this body. We wanted to be here in those historic moments of titanic debates over issues that changed the course of history and to reflect and respect the rights of the minority. But now it has become one sad example of obstructionism after another.
I think the Senator from New Mexico is moving in the right direction. I am not sure we will achieve exactly what he wants, but I can say we wouldn't have this conversation unless the Senator from New Mexico and Senator Merkley had shown such initiative for years--they have been at this for years, if I am not mistaken--and I do believe it is going to end up in changes to Senate procedure, which I support, that will try to make people stay on the floor.
I have one example. The Senator from New Mexico may remember when a Senator from Kentucky, now retired, Senator Jim Bunning, objected to the extension of unemployment benefits. We wanted to extend them for literally millions of Americans, and he stood up at his desk on the Republican side and said, ``I object,'' and then sat down. That was the end of the story. That was really the end of the debate.
So I went to the floor, and I said: I just want to give notice to the Senator from Kentucky I am going to renew that request every half hour, so you better return to the floor--because he has to object every time. This was late at night.
We mobilized a number of people in the cloakroom, and we came to the floor and we kept it going. Finally, he got up and complained he was missing the University of Kentucky basketball game on television because of this. I thought: Several million people are missing unemployment benefits because of this too.
So that is in the nature of what the Senator is trying to achieve. If there is something important enough to stop the course of the Senate activity, to stop the business of the Senate, then you should be prepared to be on the Senate floor and argue your case and bring your allies with you. If they will join you, then perhaps you will have a debate that is worthy of this body.
Unfortunately, we now have Members who make their objection and leave for dinner or for the weekend or to attend a wedding, which happened once, and you do not see them again, and the Senate waits and waits and waits. That does have to come to an end.
I thank the Senator for his leadership on this important issue. I do not know that we will take it up tomorrow, but I think we will take it up very soon, and we should.

129,CA.BOXER,CA,Boxer,"Mr. President, I rise to register my concerns with the confirmation of Dr. Joshua Wright to be a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, FTC.
The FTC's mission is to ``prevent business practices that are anticompetitive or deceptive or unfair to consumers and to enhance informed consumer choice and public understanding of the competitive process.''
Yet throughout his career, Dr. Wright has shown a disdain for this mission, and the government's involvement in protecting consumers.
As one example, Dr. Wright wrote that one government consumer protection agency's agenda was ``aggressive and dangerous'' and that its ``existence is likely to do more harm than good for consumers.''
He has also sharply criticized the FTC, arguing it has been hampered by ``a history and pattern of appointments evidencing a systematic failure to meet . . . expectations.''
Many consumer groups are also concerned about his confirmation to the FTC, noting that his antiregulation philosophy is far outside of the mainstream and runs counter to the mission of the FTC as an enforcement agency designed to protect consumers.
Dr. Wright was selected by Republican congressional leadership to fill a Republican position on the FTC, as required by statute. For this reason I did not block his confirmation, but I will be closely monitoring his activities at the FTC.",CA,BOXER,-0.488,D,mr presid rise regist concern confirm dr joshua wright commission feder trade commiss ftc ftc mission prevent busi practic anticompetit decept unfair consum enhanc inform consum choic public understand competit process yet throughout career dr wright shown disdain mission govern involv protect consum one exampl dr wright wrote one govern consum protect agenc agenda aggress danger exist like harm good consum also sharpli critic ftc argu hamper histori pattern appoint evidenc systemat failur meet expect mani consum group also concern confirm ftc note antiregul philosophi far outsid mainstream run counter mission ftc enforc agenc design protect consum dr wright select republican congression leadership fill republican posit ftc requir statut reason block confirm close monitor activ ftc
131,CA.BOXER,CA,Boxer,"Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleagues, Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Olympia Snowe.
We have served together in the Senate for two decades and I will dearly miss their grace and their friendship. I know that whatever the next chapter brings, both Senator Hutchison and Senator Snowe will leave a lasting and important legacy.
Both of these Senators are true pioneers. When she first entered Congress, Senator Snowe was the youngest Republican woman ever to serve in the House of Representatives. Senator Hutchison graduated law school in 1967 as one of only 5 women in a class of 445 men. When she arrived in the Senate in 1993, she became the first woman to represent Texas in this Chamber.
Throughout her career, Senator Snowe has been a strong advocate for the people of Maine. Whether they were children, families, consumers, or small business owners--the people of Maine knew they had a great champion in Senator Snowe.
Senator Snowe always worked across party lines to get things done for the American people. During her time in the House, she worked with Senator Mikulski to lead the fight to end the exclusion of women in health trials at the National Institutes of Health. She worked with Senator Rockefeller to help bring the internet to America's libraries and classrooms. She worked with Senator Ted Kennedy to pass the Genetic Nondiscrimination Act.
Senator Snowe and I worked together on many, many bills over the years, but I will especially remember our work on the passengers' bill of rights to provide basic protections for airline passengers. I will also remember the many times we fought together to ensure equality for women around the world.
Senator Snowe was a true leader and her presence in the Senate will be greatly missed.
Senator Hutchison was a strong and passionate voice for the issues important to her beloved State of Texas.
She played an critical role in so many of the important issues facing our country over the years, from her work ensuring the safety of our Nation as a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee to her leadership on the Senate Commerce Committee.
We worked together to promote safety and security for Afghan women and girls, and she played such a key role last during consideration of the transportation bill. I am so grateful for Senator Hutchison's bipartisan efforts to preserve and protect our critical transportation infrastructure.
Senator Hutchison has always noted that we women Senators have repeatedly come together across party lines to achieve action on women's issues: things like pay inequality and creating tax-free individual retirement accounts for spouses who work at home.
I will miss my colleagues, both on the Senate floor and at our monthly women Senators dinners.
I wish them both well in all their future endeavors.
Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague, Senator Kent Conrad, whom I have been fortunate to call a colleague and a friend. I have served with Kent for 20 years and my husband Stewart and I have valued the friendship of his and his wonderful wife Lucy Calautti.
From helping North Dakota recover from devastating natural disasters to promoting North Dakota agriculture as a key member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Kent Conrad has been a leader for North Dakota for more than 30 years.
No Senator knows budget and economic issues better than Senator Conrad and he used his knowledge to great effect as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. His exacting and precise assessments of our Nation's fiscal health added wisdom and maturity to a debate that was often difficult and divisive. His many budget charts alone are famous in the Senate--in fact, he uses even more charts on the floor than I do, which is saying something.
He refers to his policymaking approach as ``extreme moderation''--an approach that perfectly sums up Senator Conrad's philosophy and demeanor. Senator Conrad is one of our most respected members, for his steady temperament, his open mind, and his willingness to reach across the aisle in search of policy solutions.

137,MT.BAUCUS,MT,Baucus,"Mr. President, Nelson Mandela, former president of South Africa once said ``Safety and security don't just happen; they are the result of collective consensus and public investment. We owe our children, the most vulnerable citizens in our society, a life free of violence and fear.''
Today, I am proud to join with Senators Kerry, Collins, Cardin, Shaheen, Snowe, and Conrad to introduce the Protect Our Kids Act. This legislation would establish a task force dedicated to reducing child deaths from child abuse and neglect. Child welfare professionals, law enforcement officers, and other child abuse prevention experts.
Since 2002, more than 15,000 children have died due to abuse and neglect. This number is based on state-reported Child Protection Services data. But advocates predict the true number is far greater.
Unfortunately, we do not have clear facts about the number of child abuse and neglect fatalities.
Some children may have died from child abuse and neglect, even if they were not involved with the Child Protective Services system or their deaths were not reported as due to abuse or neglect. We know little about these deaths since there is no standard means of collecting this data across States. And not all State child protection agencies seek information considering child abuse or neglect fatalities from other agencies or offices like vital statistics, medical examiners, or law enforcement.
We need to learn more about the deaths of these children, so that we can prevent the senseless murders of other children. Our children deserve to be protected from fear and terror especially when the threat to their safety and well-being comes from those that should cherish them the most.
According to Child Protection Services data, in Montana we reported zero fatalities from child abuse and neglect last year. That is fantastic news. But there could be abuse or deaths not reported or not collected by Child Protection Services. So I am urging my State to lift the standard even higher. Child Protection Services needs to coordinate with other agencies for more data so that we can be sure that all Montana kids are safe.
Our Nation must embrace its responsibility to protect our children. And we need to provide our children with mental health challenges the support they need to not only survive but to thrive as members of our society.
We need to make sure that kids have access to physical and mental health services, so they can grow up into happy, productive adults. We need to help kids with mental illnesses by reducing the stigma surrounding mental health services and ensuring that kids know there is a support network backing them up. We have to use every resource at our disposal to prevent abuse and ensure mental health support. We should look at programs like home visiting, which currently provides professional assistance, right at home, for over 50,000 families across our nation, and see how they can be improved to do an even better job supporting vulnerable families.
This legislation is a step in the right direction to protect kids. I commend my colleagues Senators Kerry and Collins for their years of work on this issue. Our colleagues in the House of Representatives have already acted on this legislation. Let us now join together and create a life free of violence and fear for our most vulnerable citizens.

138,ME.COLLINS,ME,Collins,"Mr. President, I rise today to praise the passage of the ``Protect Our Kids Act,'' which will create a commission with the goal of eliminating child abuse fatalities. The effort to address child abuse transcends ideological and partisan lines. This is not a Democratic or Republican issue--this is an American issue--one that we can't wish away, but that we must face head on and work to eradicate. Senator Kerry and I originally introduced the Protect Our Kids Act last year, and I am pleased that we have moved forward with this critical, updated legislation. Senator Kerry and I also introduced a resolution recognizing April as Child Abuse Prevention Month. The passage of the Protect Our Kids Act further represents our commitment to put an end to child abuse in the United States.
Child abuse fatalities are preventable; yet, approximately 1,770 children are reported as dying from child abuse each year, and many experts believe the actual number may be significantly higher. This legislation would establish a commission to develop a national strategy for reducing child abuse fatalities. The commission will include a variety of professionals with expertise in areas such as child welfare advocacy, child development, pediatrics, medical examining, social work, law enforcement and education.
Through new research, hearings and the use and coordination of existing information, the commission will provide a report with its recommendations for developing a comprehensive national strategy for reducing child abuse fatalities. Increased understanding of maltreatment deaths can lead to improvement in agency systems and practices to protect children and prevent child abuse and neglect. Therefore, it is imperative that we take action to capitalize on the commission's findings. This legislation requires the commission's report to be submitted to relevant Federal agencies and Congressional committees. All agencies with recommendations that fall under their jurisdiction must then submit their reaction and plans to address such recommendations to Congress within 6 months.
Approximately 6 million kids are reported to be abused or neglected each year. We know this can be prevented.

148,NJ.SMITH,NJ,Smith,"Mr. Speaker, last month the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Human Rights held a hearing which examined U.S. policy regarding the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This conflict was exacerbated by Rwanda's interventions in neighboring eastern Congo, as documented by the release of three United Nations reports last year. These reports confirmed Rwanda's support of militia who have ravaged and continue to plague this region. The State Department was unavailable to testify at our September 19th hearing on this issue, and the subcommittee promised at that time to follow-up when State was available to testify.
In the aftermath of the 1994 genocide, successive U.S. administrations have turned a blind eye to reports of Rwandan plundering of resources from the DRC and support for rebels who have devastated eastern Congo and its people. It seems that guilt over the Clinton Administration's failure responding effectively to the genocide in Rwanda has led subsequent U.S. administrations to be reluctant to criticize the Government of Rwanda.
With these UN reports on that government's behavior in the DRC, we must overcome our regret over what happened 18 years ago. As an NGO letter to President Obama points out, the United States is now out of step with our European allies, who have cut aid to Rwanda because of their interference in the DRC, as recommended by the UN Group of Experts in their recent reports. The Group of Experts also recommends imposing sanctions on responsible Rwandan officials, such as Defense Minister General James Kabarebe.
Additionally, the Government of the DRC has failed to ensure that its military adequately provides security for its citizens. In fact, the National Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) also is alleged to be a perpetrator of human rights violations in the East. Security sector reform is critical in the DRC, and the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) has not been able to completely train military containing elements that too often terrorize their own people instead of protecting them.
At this point, it is vital to understand what the administration intends to do about the UN reports on Rwanda's violation of the arms embargo on non-state groups in eastern DRC and how this impacts U.S. relations with Rwanda. Furthermore, we must know how the administration intends to deal with the DRC government in light of its deficiencies in security sector reform. The hearing also took a comprehensive look at who is responsible for the insecurity in eastern Congo beyond the two government and the militias.
Most attention is being paid to the M23 rebel movement in eastern Congo, and justifiably so in light of their recent seizure of territory and overall destructive impact on the people of eastern Congo. However, there are reportedly as many as two dozen armed groups terrorizing Congolese in this region. According to a November 2012 report from Oxfam, Commodities of War, nine of these militias are believed to be most prominent. They range from those with a focus on Rwanda or Uganda, those that were formed in response to the flight of perpetrators of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda to the DRC or those singularly focused on the DRC itself. Whatever the reason for their founding, these militias have terrorized the people of eastern Congo and the DRC as a whole. We must identify their support base and end the flow of arms and other aid that enables their ongoing reign of terror.
According to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), insecurity in eastern Congo has displaced approximately 2.4 million people nationwide, especially in the East. Despite longstanding conflict in eastern Congo, OCHA estimates that the majority of displaced persons typically returns to their areas of origin within six to 18 months of their initial displacement and require minimal return assistance. While that may be true, it does not account for the kind of life Congolese will have once they can return to their homes.
Women continue to be targeted for abuse in DRC. A study that recently appeared in the American Journal of Public Health in May 2011 concluded that an average of 48 women and girls are raped every hour in this country. So, as with our February 2nd and September 19th hearings on the DRC this year, more than 100 females in DRC were raped before our hearing last month ended. Their rejection by their families and communities casts a cloud over future efforts to recreate communities destroyed by militias in the DRC. This is an issue that must be addressed by Congolese themselves--sooner rather than later.
Since our hearing in September, M23 made significant gains in territorial control, occupying Goma for 10 days while moving southward, potentially toward the South Kivu town of Bukavu. However, international pressure played a major role in the group ending its advance southward and withdrawing from Goma town by early December. DRC President Joseph Kabila's government and the M23 rebels reportedly have agreed to peace talks in Kampala sponsored by the Government of Uganda. There have been peace talks and peace accords in the DRC before, and they didn't hold. Will this effort achieve lasting peace?
The DRC is home to abundant mineral wealth, including 70 percent of the world's coltan (used to make vital components of cell phones and other electronic equipment), 30 percent of the world's diamond reserves and vast deposits of cobalt, copper and bauxite. Unfortunately, these natural resources have attracted international looters and fuelled civil war. Now oil has been discovered in eastern DRC. Can a way be found to prevent the DRC's blessings from being turned into curses?
The tragic genocide in Rwanda in 1994 has had lasting repercussions in the DRC, but since the 1880s, resentment over the perceived influx of people considered foreigners in eastern DRC has contributed to conflict in this region, including two regional wars. Various leaders in the region have used this antipathy for political purposes, pitting their supporters against their perceived opponents.

150,VA.CONNOLLY,VA,Connolly,"Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and pay tribute to Lyle W. Minter, of Fairfax, Virginia, on the occasion of his retirement after 36 years of Federal service. Mr. Minter's professional achievements are numerous, and I know he would be the first to acknowledge that none of them would have been possible without the support of his wife, Nancy.
Lyle graduated in 1975 from the University of Virginia with a B.A. in History. While at the University of Virginia, Lyle was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He received his Master of Library Science in 1976 from the University of Maryland. While at the University of Maryland, Lyle was elected to Beta Phi Mu.
Lyle began his distinguished Federal career as a civilian employee with the Department of the Army. He worked as the librarian at two Army posts in Virginia before being reassigned to the Pentagon Library as a reference librarian. He later was selected as head of the Reference Section and managed research support, general reference, and online database searching for the Pentagon Library's 50,000 patrons.
Lyle came to the Library of Congress in 1991 as Head of the Government Publications and Periodicals Section in the Serial and Government Publications Division. In that position he managed the automation of the serial binding preparation process and was instrumental in implementing a number of other enhancements and services, which enabled increased access to the Library of Congress collections for Members of Congress and the research community who utilize that institution and its vast collections. Lyle then was reassigned as Head of the Newspaper and Current Periodical Division, where he managed the Library's busiest public service point and implemented such innovations as virtual reference and online collection guides. Lyle came to the Congressional Research Service in 2005 as a Supervisory Information Research Specialist in the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division where he manages a team of employees who respond to requests from the United States Congress. He has remained in that position until the time of his retirement.
Throughout his career, Lyle has been actively engaged in the professional librarian community as a member of the Special Libraries Association (SLA), and he has received several awards for his service. He was elected a Fellow of SLA in 2004 and received the Gale Cengage Learning Murray Wortzel Award in recognition of Excellence in Social Science Librarianship in 2011. Lyle particularly enjoys teaching and mentoring information professionals, and his dedication to mentoring librarians and others in the field of librarianship has been a benchmark of his career.
As Lyle begins the next chapter of his life, he intends to spend time with friends and family, teach, travel, and continue volunteering in his community and in his profession. Lyle Minter has excelled throughout his distinguished Federal career, and I am honored to pay tribute to this conscientious and dedicated public servant.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Lyle Minter for his many years of dedicated Federal service.

151,NC.COBLE,NC,Coble,"Mr. Speaker, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or ``AIA,'' which was signed into law on September 16, 2011, is the most substantial reform of U.S. patent law since the 1836 Patent Act. The AIA re-establishes the United States patent system as the global standard. The bill that we discuss today, H.R. 6621, makes necessary technical corrections to the AIA to ensure that the bill realizes its full potential to promote innovation and create jobs.
The AIA represented the culmination of nearly a decade of work by Members, key staff, and officials from both the Bush and Obama Administrations. The bill helps to bring our patent system into the 21st century and sets our nation's innovation infrastructure on the right path for decades to come.
At the center of our successful efforts to enact the AIA and this technical corrections measure over the last decade has been Blaine Merritt, the Chief Counsel of the Committee on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition and the Internet.
Blaine has been a constant and tireless public servant, who has served the American people with quiet distinction and professionalism for nearly three decades. On the occasion of his retirement from the U.S. House of Representatives, I want to note a few of his many contributions to our work and to the betterment of the American people.
A native of Greensboro, North Carolina, Blaine's congressional career began in 1985 in our office where he began his public service as a Legislative Assistant. In 1988, he was promoted to Legislative Director, a position he served in until he was called to serve on the professional staff of the Committee on the Judiciary in 1997.
Once on the Committee, Blaine was appointed Chief Counsel to the subcommittee with oversight over our intellectual property laws and courts related issues in 2000. In that capacity, Blaine served three successive Republican Chairmen--Representatives Henry Hyde, Jim Sensenbrenner and Lamar Smith.
During his service on the Judiciary Committee, Blaine established himself and became recognized as one of our nation's foremost authorities on the law of patents, copyrights and trademarks as well as an expert on all matters that relate to the Federal judiciary and congressional procedure.
Blaine's contributions to landmark legislation are innumerable. Counted among the bills he helped to steer to enactment are the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA), the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the aforementioned Leahy-Smith AIA of 2011.
Mr. Speaker, I've been blessed to represent the good citizens of the Sixth District of North Carolina, from where Blaine hails, since 1985. Throughout my tenure, I and countless other Members of the ``People's House'' have benefitted from his sound counsel, seasoned judgment and quiet leadership.
As Blaine embarks upon the next phase of his career, I hope he takes a little time to relax and watch his beloved ``Blue Devils'' basketball team that is undefeated and ranked number one in the Nation.

153,VA.CONNOLLY,VA,Connolly,"Mr. Speaker, I rise to share with my colleagues a poignant story from a local newspaper about the experiences of a prominent African-American veteran and corporate leader in our community who was an early pioneer in breaking down the barriers of segregation. When Carlos Campbell and his family settled in Northern Virginia in the late 1960s, they found a certain amount of intolerance, but they were pleasantly surprised by the welcome they received in the new town of Reston, which at the time was a rare ``open'' community in Virginia. This story about Mr. Campbell, as reported by Gregg MacDonald of The Fairfax Times, is just one of the many things that make Reston such a wonderful community, which I am proud to represent.
As a young African-American boy growing up in Harlem, Carlos C. Campbell, now 75, lived two streets down from Brooklyn Dodgers baseball player Jackie Robinson and used to wave at Robinson as he left his home on the way to Ebbets Field. He later befriended jazz and football legends Dizzy Gillespie and Jim Brown, and worked as an actor with Charlton Heston and Robert Wagner and as a musician with jazz drummer Buddy Rich. He has written books, made films, flown planes for the U.S. Navy, worked for former President Ronald Reagan and the Defense Intelligence Agency, for the Department of Housing and Urban Development as a city planner, and was elected to the D100 as one of the most influential directors of corporate boards by the National Association of Corporate Directors. But when Campbell moved to Northern Virginia in 1968, he said that because of segregation and discrimination, he could not buy a home. ``I looked at 39 different places and it was always the same line,'' he said. ``I'm sorry, sir, we do not practice open occupancy. It was very humiliating to be turned down for a residence for someone who had served his country during the Cuban Missile Crisis and had resolved to die if that's what it took to protect it.'' Campbell said that while he was looking, he remembered a place called Reston that he had read about while a Navy aviator. ``In 1965 or so, Reston had gotten a lot of ink as an open community, so I eventually remembered hearing about it and decided to check it out.'' Chuck Veatch, an early Reston sales employee, remembers that time well. ``Because Reston in the 1960s was an `open' community within a segregated state that had no fair housing laws, we had a hard time with market resistance in terms of blacks,'' Veatch said. ``We in Reston had no issues at all, but because Realtors did not sell our homes there was some resentment, and the real estate brokerage community used the race card against us, to sell against us, and tell people they didn't want to live in Reston.'' Married and with two daughters, Campbell purchased his first Reston home, in Vantage Hill, in October 1968. He soon went to work for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington, D.C. ``It was great to finally be able to find a community in which we were tolerated,'' he said. ``But it was still no piece of cake.'' Campbell estimates that at that time, Reston consisted of about 1,500 people, about four percent of whom were African American. ``There was a group of Reston African Americans formed back then who called themselves the Reston Black Focus. I wasn't initially a part of the group, but they would have get- togethers and invite everyone. Afterwards random people would come up to me and say, `Man, you guys throw great parties' and I would say, `OK, thanks.' '' According to Campbell, although Reston was an open community, the surrounding areas of Fairfax County still were not quite there yet. ``Leaving Reston, we would be reminded of what it was really like,'' he said. ``Everywhere I went, people in their cars slowed down and asked me if I was a Washington Redskin, but I guess that was better than them yelling `nigger' out of the window as they went by, which also would happen.'' Campbell said his family also felt the effects of discrimination. ``Beauty parlors would refuse to style my wife's hair, and a swimming pool once closed down, rather than let my little girl get in the water,'' he said. Campbell said that even in Reston during that time, African Americans often were under a microscope, and whites were not sure how to interact with them. On several occasions he said he discovered people rifling through his garbage cans, who then ran off when confronted. ``I would also occasionally get a knock on my door and someone would ask me what I did for a living, or ask me if I needed a job,'' he said. ``I also used to jog and would invariably get stopped by police who would often say they were looking for a robbery suspect.'' But overall, Campbell said life in Reston was always positive. He later moved to Golf Course Island in 1970, but has remained in Reston for 44 years. ``Reston was always a great place,'' he said. ``As an African American here, I was always tolerated, and as the years went by, Reston transcended that tolerance into acceptance. I felt less like a guinea pig and more of a citizen and a member of this community. Discrimination and intolerance still exist, but it is not as overt as it once was. I am glad Reston existed when it did and I'm content to continue living here and giving back.''",VA,CONNOLLY,-0.28,D,mr speaker rise share colleagu poignant stori local newspap experi promin africanamerican veteran corpor leader commun earli pioneer break barrier segreg carlo campbel famili settl northern virginia late 1960 found certain amount intoler pleasantli surpris welcom receiv new town reston time rare open commun virginia stori mr campbel report gregg macdonald fairfax time one mani thing make reston wonder commun proud repres young africanamerican boy grow harlem carlo c campbel 75 live two street brooklyn dodger basebal player jacki robinson use wave robinson left home way ebbet field later befriend jazz footbal legend dizzi gillespi jim brown work actor charlton heston robert wagner musician jazz drummer buddi rich written book made film flown plane u navi work former presid ronald reagan defens intellig agenc depart hous urban develop citi planner elect d100 one influenti director corpor board nation associ corpor director campbel move northern virginia 1968 said segreg discrimin could buy home look 39 differ place alway line said im sorri sir practic open occup humili turn resid someon serv countri cuban missil crisi resolv die that took protect campbel said look rememb place call reston read navi aviat 1965 reston gotten lot ink open commun eventu rememb hear decid check chuck veatch earli reston sale employe rememb time well reston 1960 open commun within segreg state fair hous law hard time market resist term black veatch said reston issu realtor sell home resent real estat brokerag commun use race card us sell us tell peopl didnt want live reston marri two daughter campbel purchas first reston home vantag hill octob 1968 soon went work depart hous urban develop washington d c great final abl find commun toler said still piec cake campbel estim time reston consist 1 500 peopl four percent african american group reston african american form back call reston black focu wasnt initi part group would get togeth invit everyon afterward random peopl would come say man guy throw great parti would say ok thank accord campbel although reston open commun surround area fairfax counti still quit yet leav reston would remind realli like said everywher went peopl car slow ask washington redskin guess better yell nigger window went also would happen campbel said famili also felt effect discrimin beauti parlor would refus style wife hair swim pool close rather let littl girl get water said campbel said even reston time african american often microscop white sure interact sever occas said discov peopl rifl garbag can ran confront would also occasion get knock door someon would ask live ask need job said also use jog would invari get stop polic would often say look robberi suspect overal campbel said life reston alway posit later move golf cours island 1970 remain reston 44 year reston alway great place said african american alway toler year went reston transcend toler accept felt less like guinea pig citizen member commun discrimin intoler still exist overt glad reston exist im content continu live give back

156,VA.CONNOLLY,VA,Connolly,"Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Senior Airman Veronica Cox of Lorton, Virginia, for demonstrating exceptional personal and moral courage during humanitarian assistance after the 9.0 magnitude earthquake that hit northeast Japan on March 11th, 2011.
Airman Cox volunteered for humanitarian assistance duty and was part of the advanced command element in the town of Sanriku-cho as an intelligence analyst. Being able to communicate fluently in Japanese, she was able to greatly assist in integrating the Japanese-U.S. response within the crucial first 24 hours as well as the days that followed. She met with the village elder and clearly communicated necessary medical and survival instructions. She flew with nine search and rescue teams and directly enabled the delivery of 3,000 pounds of food, water and medical supplies
Three days after the earthquake, Airman Cox was able to recognize the Japanese characters asking for help spelled out by rocks on the roof of a senior-care facility. A further investigation led to the discovery of 200 Japanese civilians within the rubble of the building.
For her service during the crisis, Airman Cox and the aircrew received recognition from the Emperor of Japan. She received the Air Force Commendation Medal and was selected as a linguist for the 5th Air Force Vice Command during U.S. and Japanese Ministry of Defense-level meetings. She also received recognition and awards from the Japan Self-Defense forces and civilian organizations.

157,CA.ESHOO,CA,Eshoo,"Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act which contains a very special provision, the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act.
I first introduced this bill in the 110th Congress in honor of my dear friend, Ambassador Richard Sklar, who was a victim of pancreatic cancer, a devastating disease. Pancreatic cancer is essentially a death sentence, with very few surviving. It is only because of the families, friends, neighbors, doctors, and co-workers who have advocated for better research and treatments, that we've made it to the ``finish line'' legislatively after a five-year effort.
Sadly, the outcomes for those with pancreatic cancer have remained relatively unchanged since the passage of the National Cancer Act more than 40 years ago. Only 6 percent of people diagnosed with the disease live longer than 5 years, and 75 percent die within a year of diagnosis. Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal types of cancers, even as survival rates for other cancers have increased.
The Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act, which I introduced with my colleague, Representative Leonard Lance, directs the National Cancer Institute to develop a long-term strategic plan for addressing recalcitrant cancers beginning with pancreatic and lung cancers. The plan will bring together the finest minds in our country with the best expertise in this area. The plans will be used by the Agency as a roadmap for navigating the best way forward in research for early detection, new diagnostic tools, treatment therapies, and even cures.
While pancreatic cancer is one of the most devastating of all ``recalcitrant cancers,'' or those with a high mortality rate and few treatments, it is certainly not the only one that needs increased attention. I have worked closely with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to expand our legislation to include all recalcitrant cancers so that we can make progress in other areas, too.
I am exceedingly proud that this legislation enjoyed the bipartisan cosponsorship of 294 Members of the House and more than half the U.S. Senate with 58 bipartisan cosponsors. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse championed the legislation with his steadfast leadership, and without him, this effort would not have ultimately been successful.

Ilene was selected for this competitive award based on her academic ability, exemplary citizenship, and her commitment to learning and mastering a foreign language of critical importance.
While studying in Chandigarh, India, Ilene studied at the Punjabi Summer Institute and focused on creating a strong foundation for both her language fluency and her cultural competency. She participated in daily educational activities and built relationships with young leaders from all over the world with a focus on the Punjabi language, one of the thirteen ``critical needs'' foreign languages determined by the Department of State. The CLS program--a key component of the National Security Language Initiative--provides fully-funded, group-based, language instruction and structured cultural enrichment experiences to U.S. students overseas. The accelerated program of study over 8-10 weeks is approximately equivalent to one full year of language study, and includes extracurricular activities designed to supplement the formal curriculum.
Ilene is a student at the New College of Florida. It is inspiring to see young people who are interested in international educational and developmental experiences such as these.

164,VA.CONNOLLY,VA,Connolly,"Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Washington Regional Alcohol Program (WRAP) and to congratulate it on the occasion of its 30th anniversary.
Founded in 1982, WRAP is an award winning, public-private coalition formed to fight drunk driving, drugged driving, and underage drinking in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. Through educational and innovative public programs, WRAP is credited with keeping Washington area alcohol related death rates consistently below the national average. Programs and resources include Youth Outreach, Adult Outreach, and Public Education programs designed to educate students and the general public on the dangers of alcohol and drugs, particularly driving while under the influence. Through the WRAP Holiday SoberRide program, individuals who are impaired can request a free cab ride home. Since SoberRide was launched in 1993, 55,851 free cab rides have been provided, preventing possible accidents and deaths.
In 1982, the year that WRAP was founded, 26,173 people in the United States lost their lives in alcohol-related car accidents; 60% of all traffic fatalities involved drunk driving. Due to the tireless efforts of WRAP, other organizations such as MADD and SADD, local and state police, and enforcement of more stringent anti-drunk driving laws, alcohol-related traffic fatalities decreased to 9,878.
Since 1997, WRAP has sponsored an annual Law Enforcement Awards Ceremony to honor local law enforcement professionals who have gone above and beyond the call of duty in the fight against drunk driving. It is my honor to enter the following names of the 2012 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence recipients into the Congressional Record:
Officer Brandon Smith, City of Alexandria Police Department Officer Avery Carroll, Arlington County Police Department Police Officer Harold Morris, Fairfax County Police Department Deputy Alexander Brackle, Loudoun County Sheriff's Office Trooper John W. Cabrera, Maryland State Police Officer Roderick Saunders, Metropolitan Police Department Police Officer John Romack, Montgomery County Department of Police Corporal Christopher Lord, Prince George's County Police Department Police Officer Jeremy A. Schenck, Prince William County Police Department Officer Ronald Pisano, United States Park Police Senior Trooper Michael S. Middleton, Virginia State Police
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the recipients of the 2012 Law Enforcement Award of Excellence and in recognizing WRAP for its 30 years of public service. I commend the staff of WRAP under the leadership of President Kurt Erickson for their tireless dedication to eradicating underage drinking and drunk driving. Their efforts combined with the support of partner organizations and law enforcement agencies have truly saved lives and are deserving of our highest praise and gratitude.

165,MI.HUIZENGA,MI,Huizenga,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding community leader in West Michigan, and a personal friend.
David Van Dyke, a dairy farmer from Coopersville, Michigan, was recently recognized as the Michigan Farm Bureau's 2012 Volunteer of the Year.
David became involved in a local township issue when he saw a fellow farmer put at risk by a planned recreational trail that would have cut through the middle of his family farm. The trail would have bisected a beef feedlot, threatening the existence of the family business. The back half of the property could only be accessed from a point on the proposed trail.
David served as an intermediary between township and county officials, Farm Bureau, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR), and various elected officials. He helped engage the farming community and concerned neighbors in support of the local farmer and helped coordinate the appeal to the county for action.
The efforts were fruitful. The county ultimately purchased and swapped land in the community to entice the MDNR to re-route the trail around the family farm.
Echoing the words of Dave's friend and neighbor, who first nominated Van Dyke for Volunteer of the Month, ``Dave is a tireless proponent of agriculture and the local farming community. His ability to communicate and bring together people with opposing viewpoints has made him an excellent leader and liaison for the local agricultural community.''
``Dave is someone who can be counted on to go the extra mile by donating his time and services for important agricultural and community causes.''

169,MI.HUIZENGA,MI,Huizenga,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a great West Michigan company and leader in the office furniture industry. Steelcase, Inc. began serving Grand Rapids, MI in 1912 as the Metal Office Furniture Company. Today, Steelcase is known as a company of innovation and integrity.
Since the creation of its first product, the fireproof metal wastebasket, Steelcase was able to look forward in innovation and safety. Steelcase continued to move forward in the world of office furniture, when in 1953, they became the first in the industry to produce office furniture in colors. Examples of Steelcase's attention to creativity and safety continued to be shown throughout the years. Steelcase ultimately proved itself to be a company that cared about much more.
Steelcase has also been a company that focuses on its people and their capabilities. This is easily seen in their diversity and community leadership programs. Steelcase employs fair and honest hiring practices, and seeks to raise awareness of diversity issues by creating partnerships with other companies that support diversity.
Steelcase has demonstrated a commitment to local involvement, contributing to over 100 community organizations around the United States. Additionally that philanthropic spirit carries over into the culture of the Steelcase team, where the employees volunteered nearly 4,500 hours of community service in 2010 alone.
These ideals continue to set Steelcase apart, and the company is now recognized as a symbol of excellence around the world. Steelcase now employs over 11,000 people worldwide, and 3,500 people in West Michigan. Today, the company's product line has expanded to over 500 items, and serves over 110,000 companies around the globe.
Steelcase has proven itself to be a company built on great ideas, and continues to live up to this model as they move forward. Steelcase has recently introduced the ``100 Dreams, 100 Minds, 100 Years'' program. The movement looks to create a dialogue with people from around the world, and showcase their ideas and perspectives in a film centered on the future of the changing world of work.

170,MN.ELLISON,MN,Ellison,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Senator Paul Wellstone and to recognize his leadership, integrity, and the lasting impact he has had on the citizens of Minnesota and the United States.
Last year marked the tenth anniversary of the tragic death of Senator Wellstone, who was killed in a plane crash in Northern Minnesota on October 25, 2002, along with his wife, Sheila Wellstone, their daughter Marcia, members of the Senator's campaign staff Tom Lapic, Mary McEvoy, and Will McLaughlin, and the plane's two pilots Richard Conry and Michael Guess.
Paul should not be remembered for the tragedy of his death, but rather the energy with which he lived his life. Born in Washington, DC, Senator Wellstone took a teaching position at Carleton College in Northfield, MN, after graduating from the University of North Carolina. While a professor at Carleton College, Paul inspired his students though his teaching of political science in the classroom and his grassroots organizing in the community. When his position at the college was in question, students rallied around him and successfully lobbied the college not only to protect his job, but to grant him tenure. The activism he infused in his teaching is felt today on Capitol Hill, where a number of his former students continue to work towards greater equality for all Americans.
Paul's activism extended beyond the college campus. He worked throughout the state of Minnesota, organizing labor groups, farmers, and immigrant communities; championing causes such as public housing, healthcare, and improved education. Paul's work led to his successful Senate bid in 1990, and re-election in 1996, campaigning from the back of a beat-up old school bus painted his signature green. In Washington, Paul continued his legacy of progressive policy, particularly working towards mental health parity. Paul never did what was expedient, instead he did what he felt was right, standing up for those without a strong voice in Congress. Paul was one of the few senators to vote against the authorization of war in Iraq, shortly before the 2002 election. He knew this vote might cost him his seat in the Senate, and he was the only senator up for reelection to vote no.
Throughout his academic and political career, Paul was matched in energy and determination by his wife, Sheila. An outspoken advocate for women and families experiencing domestic violence, Sheila brought the conversation about domestic violence in our communities to a national level, and was instrumental in passing the first Violence Against Women Act. A leading voice for women in the United States, she also extended her focus to international human rights abuses and spoke out for victims of sex trafficking. She helped make the fight against domestic violence a national priority.
Paul and Sheila's work is continued with groups such as Wellstone Action, which promotes progressive causes and has trained over 55,000 candidates, campaign staff, and community organizers around the country, and the Sheila Wellstone Institute, which continues Sheila's work of ending the violence against women and children.
Paul's legacy is not encapsulated in a specific cause or any individual vote, but by his embodiment of public service. He was an example of how to live a life dedicated to values and the greater good. Paul did not make decisions based on whether they were right politically, but whether they met his basic principles of fairness, generosity, and compassion.
Senator Wellstone was a political inspiration for me, and I am proud to call him my friend. He will always be remembered as a champion for the underserved, a master at grassroots campaigning, a fervent public speaker, and a Minnesota icon. Many of my colleagues have stood on the floor here and in the Senate over the last ten years, remembering his presence as we unsuccessfully try to fill the gap he left behind in politics. A truly uncommon politician, I believe if we live by Senator Wellstone's actions, our country will be better for it.

172,NY.SERRANO,NY,Serrano,"Mr. Speaker, as the only New York City member of the Appropriations Committee, what I saw last night is something that I hadn't seen before. Whenever a disaster hit any part of this country, we always got together and found the funds to deal with the issue. We didn't worry about what section of the country it was for or what kind of disaster, we came together and we did it.
In addition, there was something that happened last night that doesn't bode well for this House, and that is that if there's one thing we still have in this House, in spite of all our problems, is that when we give our word, we keep it.

178,NY.SCHUMER,NY,Schumer,"Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation we are about to vote on that will provide an additional $9.7 billion to the National Flood Insurance Program. Without these funds, the program would have run out of money next week, leaving over 100,000 victims of Hurricane Sandy in the lurch.
I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for allowing this vote to go forward. They have acted honorably. The good news is the House passed this bill this morning and the Senate will pass it in a few minutes.
With the passage of this bill, hurricane victims from Staten Island to east Long Island, as well as in New Jersey, can rest assured their flood insurance will have enough money to pay out claims. We had no choice but to pass this provision because the Federal Government is obligated to reimburse when people have floods if they have paid in their flood insurance.
While this bill is important, it is something we were almost obligated to do, and we should not have parades down the street because this bill has passed.
The major work of helping the victims of Sandy is still ahead of us. The bad news is we even had to go through this dog-and-pony show in the first place.
Last month, the Senate passed a good, strong bill to help all victims of Hurricane Sandy, and the House simply could have taken it up and passed it. In fact, they promised to vote on a similar provision before the last Congress ended.
Unfortunately, this changed at the last moment. We do not need to get into the whys right now; we just want it to happen, and we are worried the second major portion of this relief bill will not get through the House in the form it should.
We need the House to pass not only the $9 billion they passed this morning but the $51 billion that contains the bulk of the aid people need, without which we will not be able to recover. To be a bride and left at the altar once is bad enough. To be left twice would be unconscionable.
As I said, this is a good step that we are going to pass this $9 billion flood insurance bill. This is a good but small first step. It is a small downpayment on the much larger amount of aid we need to get through Congress.
Let me tell you what is not in this bill. What is not in this bill is help for every homeowner who does not have flood insurance and lost their home or suffered major damage.
Homeowners are waiting for Congress to pass relief the way we did for Irene and Katrina and so many other disasters so they can get a contractor to sign a contract, get a bank to make a loan until they know that the Federal Government will be there to reimburse, as it always has in the past.
What is not in this bill is aid to small businesses, small businesspeople who are hanging by their fingernails, who might not be able to restart their businesses unless there is Federal aid, which was already in the Senate bill. Unless it comes back from the House and we are able to pass it in the Senate, they will be hurt.
What is not in this bill is dollars to rebuild our highways and, most importantly, our mass transit systems that were flood, damaged. The MTA alone has taken out a $5 billion loan, but it will be in real financial jeopardy unless it is assured that it will be reimbursed for all the damage that Sandy caused to our railroads and our tunnels and our mass transit system--our amazing mass transit system that brings 3\1/2\ million people off and on Manhattan Island every single day.
What is not in this bill is help to bring the electricity system back up to snuff so there will not be major blackouts, so people can be assured of their electricity.
What is not in this bill is help for all of the communities that laid out hundreds of millions and billions of dollars for the cleanup. Their taxpayers will foot the bill unless Congress does what it has always done: step to the plate when a major disaster occurs and have the Federal Government help the locality. There has been a wisdom for 100 years that when an area is afflicted by a disaster, we unite as a nation and come together and help that part of the country whether it is New Mexico or California or Louisiana or Florida or Missouri or North Dakota or New York or New Jersey.
This bill is a first step to deal with flood insurance. It is the easiest part. The hard stuff is still ahead of us. We await the House returning in a week and a half, and we hope and expect, in fact, that they will vote the full $51 billion remainder. We hope and expect, in fact, that they will not put in legislative language that prevents money from getting to homeowners and communities that need it desperately right away.
The draft we have seen contains some major changes from the Senate bill that would make it very difficult for NIH, the Army Corps, and other parts of the government to spend the dollars that are needed efficiently and quickly and to place them where they go. We beseech the House to finish its business, to finish the major part of its business, and approve the $51 billion that will make up the rest of the $60.
We beseech them not to hamstring the local homeowners and businesses and governments with language that would prevent recovery. We beseech them to move quickly. Of course, the ideal would be for them to pass the same bill that the Senate passed in the waning hours of the last session. If they cannot, we will have to get legislation through the body again. But through the generosity of the majority leader, he has assured us it will be the first order of business when we return. So we have to move forward.
As we have seen, this is not going to be easy. There are many bumps in the road and obstacles that we cannot yet see. For sure they will arise and for sure we will have to grapple with them.
This vote needs to be the beginning of the process. It cannot certainly be the end, and it certainly cannot be the middle. We cannot just pass the $9 billion bill and then say that is it. We cannot let the House pass this and rest on its laurels. We in New York and New Jersey cannot let our guard down. Not until the full $60 billion arrives in New York and New Jersey can we stop working. So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and then alert them to keep the victims of Sandy in New York, New Jersey, and elsewhere in their thoughts so that we can continue to support the region when we return.

180,NV.REID,NV,Reid,"Mr. President, in the years I have served in legislative bodies, which is quite a long time now, it is interesting to see how different people approach the legislative process. I have learned over the years there is nothing more important than people working hard. You have to be tenacious to get legislation passed.
The leader of passing Sandy over here--and I am confident when we get back in a couple of weeks after the House works on theirs, the same dynamic will be here--the senior Senator from New York has worked tirelessly to get legislation passed. He has led a team effort of Senators from New Jersey and his partner, Senator Gillibrand, but the leader, the quarterback, has been the Senator from New York.
The work he has done not only in the Senate, but having the many years of experience he had in the House of Representatives, the Presiding Officer, the senior Senator from New York, worked day and night making phone calls, personal contacts with people in New York and New Jersey who could call House Members and have them pass this legislation.
On the way back from the joint session dealing with the electoral vote count, he walked up and grabbed me--did not grab me, but we talked for several minutes walking back to the Senate--the majority leader from the House of Representatives. He worked extremely hard on this. He worked hard on it. I indicated to him that I had received calls from people in New York who appreciated very much his efforts to try to get this thing passed.
I really do believe it is important that I have the record reflect the reason we have gotten as far as we have on Sandy is because of the senior Senator from New York. It is too bad that it has taken so long. When we had that devastation from Katrina, we were there within days taking care of Mississippi, Alabama, and especially Louisiana--within days. We are now past 2 months with the people of New York and New Jersey.
The people of New Orleans and that area, they were hurt but nothing in comparison to what happened to the people in New York and New Jersey. Almost 1 million people have lost their homes; 1 million people lost their homes. That is homes, that is not people in those homes. So I think it is just unfortunate that we do not have the relief for New York and New Jersey and the rest already. It has to be done. We have to meet the needs of the American people when an act of God occurs.
So I, on behalf of the entire Senate, and certainly my Democratic caucus, express my appreciation to the legislative initiative and the legislative expertise of my friend from New York, an experienced legislator in the State of New York, the House of Representatives, and the Senate.

181,CO.UDALL,CO,Udall,"Mr. President, today marks my 28th time here on the Senate floor to talk about the Production Tax Credit for wind energy. Twenty-seven other times I stood here--oftentimes joined by like-minded colleagues from around the country--to urge Congress to extend this vital tax credit, which has helped the wind industry create tens of thousands of jobs and spur tens of billions of dollars in investment. And Coloradans have been with me the whole way.
Well, Mr. President, 27 must be a lucky number--because today, I am thrilled to use my time to thank my colleagues for making the extension of the PTC a reality. Earlier this week, Congress came together across party lines to do the right thing to assist our fragile economic recovery.
Throughout my previous efforts here on the floor, I talked a lot about jobs. From Colorado to Kansas, Oregon and Maine and the Carolinas, my remarks always came back to one simple but true statement: the PTC equals jobs.
These are good-paying jobs for hardworking Americans. From gearboxes in Georgia to wind blades in Rhode Island to towers in Colorado, the construction of wind turbines has invigorated an entire supply chain. Factories in the Midwest have been retooled to make steel components that are shipped to places like Iowa, where cutting edge composite materials are used to make state of the art blades for turbines that ultimately create wind farms built with labor from local construction workers. That's thousands of jobs across this country.
Wind generates clean, renewable energy, which helps move our country toward a more secure energy future. This is clean, American energy that does not produce carbon dioxide pollution--and by making it here at home, it helps us become less reliant on foreign nations for our energy security.
These wind farms are also paying dividends to towns and counties across America, benefitting the families who live there and the small businesses that operate there. The tax revenues from wind turbines have allowed communities to build new schools and roads, as well as provide other basic services. These additional sources of income have been especially important during the recent economic downturn, where the budgets of many states and rural communities have been stretched thin. Quite simply, wind energy jobs have a positive ripple effect wherever they are.
I am relieved that after months of uncertainty as to whether or not the PTC would be extended, Congress has finally done the commonsense thing, making sure we did not lose this vital tax credit. Although it was my preference to have Congress act much sooner and prevent the thousands of layoffs that resulted from the uncertainty Congress created, I am pleased that we have finally acted for the good of our constituents.
With the passage of the PTC, the wind industry can get back to doing the important work of moving America toward a clean energy future, a direction that will benefit middle-class American workers and ensure America leads the world in clean energy manufacturing, even as foreign competitors like China work to surpass us.
And the final language passed by Congress will have an immediate and positive impact on the construction of new wind farms. This year, projects will be eligible to take advantage of the PTC if construction begins before the end of 2013, rather than racing to complete the project by the end of the year. This commonsense change in the law will encourage larger, longer-term projects over the course of the next few years as opposed to just in 2013, which is particularly important since Congress did not pass the extension until the very last minute.
I was not alone in this fight. Coloradans motivated me to keep up the battle the entire time. And many of my colleagues--both Republicans and Democrats--joined me. In particular, I would like to thank Senator Grassley of Iowa--the ``father of the wind PTC''--for his efforts to get this done.
Senator Baucus and Senator Bingaman have also been long-time champions of the PTC on the Finance Committee, and were an integral part of the fight to extend it. My good friend and colleague from Colorado Senator Bennet has also been a strong supporter of the PTC, joining me in speeches, letters, and legislation. Senator Moran of Kansas has been right there with us as well.
And many more members from both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol supported these efforts. The broadly bipartisan and bicameral group was driven by a mutual commitment to creating jobs, simultaneously improving our economy and economic competitiveness while moving us toward a more secure energy future.
Despite the importance of the wind PTC extension, there is still much more work to do. This extension only lasts until the end of 2013. So, although we might want to take a breather, we cannot. Instead, we must begin work today on a path forward that will give the wind industry much-needed certainty over the long term. Without certainty, businesses cannot do the long-term planning that is necessary to robustly grow and add good-paying American jobs. And, this time, we cannot wait until the last minute to do it. We must work together to find a plan that allows this industry to reach maturity and thrive while also being fiscally responsible. Yes, that means a gradual phase-out of the wind PTC in the coming years--but my goal is to get Congress to also work together on comprehensive energy legislation that creates long-term certainty for all energy sources. I strongly believe that any national energy policy we develop should reflect the success Colorado has had as an all-of-the-above energy State.
Again, I want to thank my colleagues who worked alongside me to push the wind PTC extension over the finish line. This is hugely important to maintaining American jobs, manufacturing prowess, and energy security.

183,OR.MERKLEY,OR,Merkley,"Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the dysfunction of the Senate, the rules of this governing body, and what we need to do to change them in order to take on the big challenges we face as a Nation.
These last 2 years have created an unprecedented sense among the American people that Congress isn't measuring up to the needs of our time.
This is especially troubling when we are up against tremendous challenges: the most profound jobs crisis in a generation; skyrocketing income inequality; and a tax system that unfairly rewards the wealthy and well-connected over working Americans who are struggling to make ends meet.
But unfortunately, we can't tackle this jobs crisis or the problem of inequality until this body, our revered Senate, restores the ability to debate, deliberate and decide on strategies to take our Nation forward.
I believe that reforming the filibuster is one of the most critical steps we can take to repair the Senate and rebuild confidence in Congress's ability to govern.
When I first came to the Senate, it was 1976. What I saw then could hardly have been farther from the Senate of today. Routine use of the ``filibuster''--or to put it differently, a routine use of an objection to a simple majority vote--has turned the U.S. Senate into a supermajority body.
In short, the U.S. Senate, which once claimed to be ``the world's greatest deliberative body,'' has possibly become ``the world's least deliberative body.'' The institution of the Senate will not function again until we end the abuse of the filibuster. We must put an end to the silent, secret filibuster that is paralyzing the Senate.
The use of this objection has expanded dramatically in recent decades. What was once used only to block legislation that conflicted with deep, personal principles is now used as a routine political strategy for deliberate paralysis. In the 6 years Lyndon Baines Johnson was majority leader, he dealt with one filibuster. Leader Reid during his 6 years as majority leader: 391.
One casualty of the partisan filibuster is executive branch and judicial nominations. The Senate's power to advise and consent, as provided in the Constitution, was never intended to enable the legislators to inflict deep harm on the other branches of government. Yet that is exactly what has happened. Nearly one out of every eleven judgeships is vacant--triple the rate of 8 years ago. Our court systems are severely strained, with 27 vacancies rated as ``judicial emergencies'' at the end of 2012.
This is deeply damaging, for several reasons. It prevents the legislature from responding to the Nation's pressing problems and severely hampers the executive and judicial branches, which rely on the Senate to confirm their leaders. Because the Senate is unable to fulfill, on a timely basis, its constitutional responsibility to ``advise and consent'' to nominations, judgeships and executive branch management positions simply go unfilled.
Now, you may wonder, if this system is so dysfunctional, why did our Founding Fathers ever design the Senate like this? The answer is that they didn't. The Founders envisioned the Senate and House passing legislation and confirming nominations by a simple majority, reserving supermajority for special purposes such as constitutional amendments and overriding a veto.
Alexander Hamilton, in fact, foresaw the current state of affairs in the Federalist Papers, observing that a supermajority requirement would have the ``tendency to embarrass the operations of government,'' and would create ``tedious delays, continual negotiation and intrigue, [and] contemptible compromises of the public good.''
As a result of the Senate's silent filibuster, the Senate failed to pass almost all of the appropriations bills in the last Congress. The number of bills the Senate passes has hit new lows, with fewer than 3 percent of bills introduced in the last Senate ever passing.
That is why yesterday, with my partner, Senator Tom Udall, I introduced a resolution that will enhance debate and limit obstruction.
Core to these reforms is the ``talking filibuster.'' A Senator can still object but she or he must be continuously on the floor maintaining a debate on the subject. This still allows Senators to block a simple majority vote on a bill of profound consequence, but they have to spend a lot of time and energy to do so.
This reform would have two major consequences. By requiring time and energy to filibuster, it would strip away filibusters on noncontroversial issues that are currently used just to obstruct and delay, allowing the Senate to debate and decide issues. Second, it puts the filibuster on display before the American people, increasing transparency and accountability. If you filibuster, you must make your case before your colleagues and the public, so they know who is obstructing and what your arguments are, and allow the people to judge if you are a hero or a bum.
Senate dysfunction is compromising the Senate's ability to respond to major issues facing our Nation. I want to thank Leader Reid for reserving the right to not adopt the rules of the previous Congress, so we can have this important debate on the rules of this body when we come back from the State work period.",OR,MERKLEY,-0.451,D,mr presid rise today talk dysfunct senat rule govern bodi need chang order take big challeng face nation last 2 year creat unpreced sens among american peopl congress isnt measur need time especi troubl tremend challeng profound job crisi gener skyrocket incom inequ tax system unfairli reward wealthi wellconnect work american struggl make end meet unfortun cant tackl job crisi problem inequ bodi rever senat restor abil debat deliber decid strategi take nation forward believ reform filibust one critic step take repair senat rebuild confid congresss abil govern first came senat 1976 saw could hardli farther senat today routin use filibusteror put differ routin use object simpl major voteha turn u senat supermajor bodi short u senat claim world greatest delib bodi possibl becom world least delib bodi institut senat function end abus filibust must put end silent secret filibust paralyz senat use object expand dramat recent decad use block legisl conflict deep person principl use routin polit strategi deliber paralysi 6 year lyndon bain johnson major leader dealt one filibust leader reid 6 year major leader 391 one casualti partisan filibust execut branch judici nomin senat power advis consent provid constitut never intend enabl legisl inflict deep harm branch govern yet exactli happen nearli one everi eleven judgeship vacanttripl rate 8 year ago court system sever strain 27 vacanc rate judici emerg end 2012 deepli damag sever reason prevent legislatur respond nation press problem sever hamper execut judici branch reli senat confirm leader senat unabl fulfil time basi constitut respons advis consent nomin judgeship execut branch manag posit simpli go unfil may wonder system dysfunct found father ever design senat like answer didnt founder envis senat hous pass legisl confirm nomin simpl major reserv supermajor special purpos constitut amend overrid veto alexand hamilton fact foresaw current state affair federalist paper observ supermajor requir would tendenc embarrass oper govern would creat tediou delay continu negoti intrigu contempt compromis public good result senat silent filibust senat fail pass almost appropri bill last congress number bill senat pass hit new low fewer 3 percent bill introduc last senat ever pass yesterday partner senat tom udal introduc resolut enhanc debat limit obstruct core reform talk filibust senat still object must continu floor maintain debat subject still allow senat block simpl major vote bill profound consequ spend lot time energi reform would two major consequ requir time energi filibust would strip away filibust noncontroversi issu current use obstruct delay allow senat debat decid issu second put filibust display american peopl increas transpar account filibust must make case colleagu public know obstruct argument allow peopl judg hero bum senat dysfunct compromis senat abil respond major issu face nation want thank leader reid reserv right adopt rule previou congress import debat rule bodi come back state work period
184,CO.UDALL,CO,Udall,"Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Dr. Ben Eiseman, a world-renowned surgeon, a true American and a great friend of mine. Dr. Eiseman was an accomplished man in every sense of the word and is survived by his wife of 67 years, his four children and five grandchildren.
Dr. Eiseman was an incredibly intelligent individual and an avid self-learner. He graduated from Yale University in 1939 and went on to receive his Medical Degree from Harvard University in 1943. Dr. Eiseman possessed extraordinary scientific ingenuity that led him to discover an astonishing number of medical complications and cures.
In addition to these discoveries, Dr. Eiseman also authored and coauthored over 450 scientific papers, was principal editor of seven books on general surgery and was a retired Rear Admiral in the U.S. Navy Reserves--he was very proud of his service to his country. Whenever I mentioned Dr. Eiseman to other surgeons, whether they live in another State or another country, he or she would instantly know his name.
I worked with Dr. Eiseman during my time as Executive Director of the Colorado Outward Bound School. At that time he was chairman of the Board of Trustees, and he was a major influence in my life, an incredible friend, and a wise mentor. One of the reasons Dr. Eiseman and I were so close had much to do with our shared love for the great outdoors. He was one of the few people I knew who had climbed all of the mountains in Colorado over 14,000 feet.
I recall a time almost three decades ago--while I was still with Outward Bound--when Dr. Eiseman accompanied me on a winter climbing trip for advanced climbers. He was always asking us to think through each and every step. In asking the right questions and challenging us along the way, he made me a stronger leader.
One reason we all respected Dr. Eiseman was because we all admired his unassuming ruggedness. On this trip, where it was at least 10 degrees below zero, none of us were surprised as Dr. Eiseman walked around comfortably in his Converse high-tops while the rest of us muddled around, freezing in our high-tech, insulated boots. When it was time to rest for the night, most of the team rolled out their latest and greatest sleeping bags, while Dr. Eiseman pulled out the equivalent of a lawn chair cushion to curl up on for the night. Always the task master, Dr. Eiseman was the first one up in the morning to make sure that everyone, including myself, was thoroughly prepared to take on whatever was in store for us each day.

185,NM.UDALL,NM,Udall,"Mr. President, just a few weeks ago Americans gathered all across the Nation to commemorate Veterans Day. It is a day that we set aside to remember, and express our gratitude to, the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. It is a day to honor the heroes among us, and those who, sadly, have left us.
Today I wish to pay tribute to an American hero, Army SGT Clinton K. Ruiz. Sergeant Ruiz died on October 25 while on patrol in Uruzgan Province, Afghanistan, from injuries sustained from small arms fire. He was just 22 years old. He leaves behind a wife, Kira, and a baby son, Caleb.
As we face the tragedy of this brave young soldier's death, it is important too that we remember his life. Sergeant Ruiz's journey on this Earth ended far too soon, but his memory among those whose lives he touched, and in a nation's gratitude, will endure.
Clinton Ruiz was born on March 14, 1990. He graduated from Murrieta Valley High School in Murrieta, CA, and enlisted with the Army in 2009. He was assigned to A Company, 9th Military Information Support Battalion, 8th Military Information Support Group. Sergeant Ruiz was deployed to Afghanistan in September.
In the decade that our military has been fighting in Afghanistan, thousands of our fellow citizens have volunteered to serve. These courageous men and women risk their own safety to protect the safety of others. They leave their homes and their loved ones to defend the freedoms that we hold dear. Over 2,000 of these heroes have paid the ultimate price, for our freedoms, in Afghanistan.
Words cannot lessen the sorrow of the loved ones who grieve for Sergeant Ruiz now. Words cannot fully express the gratitude our Nation owes this valiant soldier. We can only remember, indeed we must never forget, the sacrifice that SGT Clinton Ruiz made in service to our country.
President Kennedy said that ``stories of past courage . . . can teach, they can offer hope, they can provide inspiration. But, they cannot supply courage itself. For this, each man must look into his own soul.'' Sergeant Clinton Ruiz had such courage. In the face of great danger, at great risk to himself, he went where his country sent him. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. He kept the promise he had made to serve. Our Nation is forever in his debt.
Sergeant Ruiz loved his family. He loved his country. He made the ultimate sacrifice defending it. To Sergeant Ruiz's family, I offer my deepest sympathies. We honor Sergeant Ruiz's courage. We remember his sacrifice. And we mourn your loss.",NM,UDALL,-0.431,D,mr presid week ago american gather across nation commemor veteran day day set asid rememb express gratitud men women serv arm forc day honor hero among us sadli left us today wish pay tribut american hero armi sgt clinton k ruiz sergeant ruiz die octob 25 patrol uruzgan provinc afghanistan injuri sustain small arm fire 22 year old leav behind wife kira babi son caleb face tragedi brave young soldier death import rememb life sergeant ruiz journey earth end far soon memori among whose live touch nation gratitud endur clinton ruiz born march 14 1990 graduat murrieta valley high school murrieta ca enlist armi 2009 assign compani 9th militari inform support battalion 8th militari inform support group sergeant ruiz deploy afghanistan septemb decad militari fight afghanistan thousand fellow citizen volunt serv courag men women risk safeti protect safeti other leav home love one defend freedom hold dear 2 000 hero paid ultim price freedom afghanistan word cannot lessen sorrow love one griev sergeant ruiz word cannot fulli express gratitud nation owe valiant soldier rememb inde must never forget sacrific sgt clinton ruiz made servic countri presid kennedi said stori past courag teach offer hope provid inspir cannot suppli courag man must look soul sergeant clinton ruiz courag face great danger great risk went countri sent award bronz star purpl heart kept promis made serv nation forev debt sergeant ruiz love famili love countri made ultim sacrific defend sergeant ruiz famili offer deepest sympathi honor sergeant ruiz courag rememb sacrific mourn loss
186,NM.UDALL,NM,Udall,"Mr. President, in the annals of our Nation's military history, the story of the defenders of Bataan will long live in our collective memory. One of those great defenders, Mr. Virgil Wallace, recently passed away at the age of 99. Mr. Wallace survived the 4 month battle, the infamous Bataan Death March, and 3 years of horrendous captivity. He was the State of New Mexico's oldest Bataan veteran.
Our Nation is forever in debt to the extraordinary courage and sacrifice that Mr. Wallace and the ``Battling Bastards of Bataan'' demonstrated in the early days of World War II. Their heroic resistance helped slow the Japanese advance, allowing crucial time for the Allied forces to reorganize and eventually reverse Japan's progress. They played a crucial role in our Nation's history. I am proud to have sponsored legislation to award these valiant soldiers the Congressional Gold Medal.
The Japanese attack on the Philippines in December, 1941, just hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, led to 4 months of intense combat. Outnumbered, outgunned, Mr. Wallace and his fellow soldiers put up a desperate fight. For 4 months, they struggled, they valiantly fought, against impossible odds, and without hope of resupply, until they finally surrendered.
Their suffering was only just beginning. The brutal Bataan Death March was followed by terrible conditions in Japanese prisons and work camps. Starvation. Torture. Forced work. And, for so many of these brave men, death. By the time they were rescued, toward the end of the war, half of New Mexico's 1,800 soldiers serving in Bataan had died. Another 300 would die from complications related to their captivity within a year of returning to the U.S. Mr. Wallace was held captive for more than 3 horrific years.
Virgil Wallace was awarded the Bronze Star and numerous other commendations for his heroic service. After the war, he returned to New Mexico, where he worked for the Department of Transportation and later Carrie Tingley Hospital in Truth or Consequences.
Our Nation will long remember this courageous soldier, a man who gave so much in service to his country. Mr. Wallace is one of the last of a legendary band of brothers, who represented the very best of who we are. In the dark days of the beginning of World War II, they showed America's fighting spirit and inspired a nation.
I extend my deepest sympathies to Mr. Wallace's family and friends. I hope that you will find comfort in your memories of his long, and distinguished, life. We honor his valor and his example, and we mourn your loss.

193,OH.RYAN,OH,Ryan,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of an exemplary public servant, Sheriff Randall A. Wellington. Sheriff Wellington will be retiring this year after serving the Ohio Mahoning County with distinction during a career that spanned seven decades. After serving as a Sergeant in the United States Army during the Korean War, Sheriff Wellington joined the Youngstown Police Force as a cadet in 1957. He was later promoted to Sergeant in 1966, Vice Squad Chief in 1970, Lieutenant in 1972, Captain in 1973, and Police Chief in 1984. After four decades serving the people of the Mahoning County and its largest city, Youngstown, Mr. Wellington became the County Sheriff on August 28, 1999. Sheriff Wellington, who is affectionately known as a soft-spoken, but firm leader, has many achievements to accompany his long and distinguished career. Among those achievements are the creation of the Senior-citizens Watch Program and the Day-Reporting Program. The latter program, initiated in 2006, allowed misdemeanor offenders to serve time doing community service rather than being incarcerated, which has saved the county about $1 million since enactment. Other initiatives introduced by Sheriff Wellington are the Reserve Deputy Program, Underwater Diving Team, Crisis Response Team, Hostage Negotiations Team and the Youth Explorer's Unit. I want to extend my warmest thanks to Sheriff Wellington for his lifelong devotion to protecting and serving the people of Mahoning County. His long and illustrious career and will not be forgotten and I would like to wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement.

His message cuts across dividing lines and highlights what unites, rather than what divides, those he represents. In both the United States and India, every election is an affirmation, not just of those who the people choose to elect, but of the very foundation on which our societies are built--the idea that the power of government rests with the governed. Mr. Modi understands the great responsibility entrusted to elected officials, and he has used his position to advocate for sound economic policies that have grown the economy of Gujarat at an astonishing rate over his past two terms. Businesses flock to Gujarat, creating jobs and raising the standard of living for its citizens. The successes achieved through Mr. Modi's leadership have drawn praise from his countrymen and observers abroad, as well as from the Indian Diaspora around the world.

196,CA.WAXMAN,CA,Waxman,"Mr. Speaker, as we begin a new Congress with many disappointments behind us and many challenges before us, I'd like to take a moment to note legislation that has proven successful beyond all expectations--the Orphan Drug Act. And I'd also like to note the recent passing of one that bill's first champions--Jack Klugman.
Before 1983, people suffering from a rare disease had little or no hope that a treatment or cure would be developed, despite the fact that many potential treatments for those diseases existed. By definition, the market for a drug for rare disease was too small to attract drug companies to do the research and go through the approval process. It was a classic case of market failure. And, for better or for worse, pharmaceutical research usually depends on the market.
So we had to invent an incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to do something that was squarely in the public interest. We had to make the development of orphan treatments something companies themselves wanted to do.
To do so, we created incentives: intellectual-property protections, tax benefits, and regulatory advantages. But, like many good bills on complicated issues, the Orphan Drug Act got bogged down.
And that's when the unexpected champion emerged--the Hollywood actor Jack Klugman. He was a big star and he had read about the problems of people with rare diseases. He used his television show, Quincy, to highlight the issue. (The show even hired people with rare diseases to serve as extras in a fictional demonstration outside the Capitol.) He was a witness before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, which I chaired. He went on to bring national attention to this problem that affected many, many people--but people in groups so small that they could never on their own get the help they needed.
The bill passed the House. Ultimately, with the help of my friend and colleague, Senator Orrin Hatch, it also passed the Senate. President Reagan signed it into law on January 4, 1983.
And the rest, as they say, is history--good history. The Act has been very successful. Over the thirty years between then and now, hundreds of orphan drugs have been approved and millions of Americans with rare diseases have been helped.
There is still a lot to be done. There are thousands of rare diseases without treatments. The cost of many orphan drugs and many other drugs is still far too high. But this Act and the amendments made to it since then have made great progress.
I'm sad to say that Jack Klugman died last week. He'd had a great career in entertainment and he will be remembered for that. But we can also all be grateful to him for his starring role in bringing this bill to the public and helping it become law. And we in the Congress can be proud of what the Orphan Drug Act has done.",CA,WAXMAN,-0.425,D,mr speaker begin new congress mani disappoint behind us mani challeng us id like take moment note legisl proven success beyond expectationsth orphan drug act id also like note recent pass one bill first championsjack klugman 1983 peopl suffer rare diseas littl hope treatment cure would develop despit fact mani potenti treatment diseas exist definit market drug rare diseas small attract drug compani research go approv process classic case market failur better wors pharmaceut research usual depend market invent incent pharmaceut industri someth squar public interest make develop orphan treatment someth compani want creat incent intellectualproperti protect tax benefit regulatori advantag like mani good bill complic issu orphan drug act got bog that unexpect champion emergedth hollywood actor jack klugman big star read problem peopl rare diseas use televis show quinci highlight issu show even hire peopl rare diseas serv extra fiction demonstr outsid capitol wit subcommitte health environ chair went bring nation attent problem affect mani mani peoplebut peopl group small could never get help need bill pass hous ultim help friend colleagu senat orrin hatch also pass senat presid reagan sign law januari 4 1983 rest say historygood histori act success thirti year hundr orphan drug approv million american rare diseas help still lot done thousand rare diseas without treatment cost mani orphan drug mani drug still far high act amend made sinc made great progress im sad say jack klugman die last week hed great career entertain rememb also grate star role bring bill public help becom law congress proud orphan drug act done
197,CA.DAVIS,CA,Davis,"Mr. Speaker, I rise with great sorrow to mourn the passing of one of San Diego's greatest leaders and humanitarians, Murray Galinson. Every city should have a Murray Galinson. On paper, Murray's impressive biography tells of a bank CEO and President, the head of a local synagogue, a former assistant U.S. attorney, a member of the board of trustees for California State University and a philanthropist playing a pivotal role in developing so many local charities. But in life, Murray was so much more than that. Murray was San Diego's go to person. When you wanted to know anything you went to Murray. When you wanted to vent frustration, you went to Murray. When you wanted someone to talk to, you went to Murray. He was a very, very special person at the center of everything. For someone so prominent Murray was not intimidating. He was open to me almost 40 years ago at the beginning of my career as he has been to so many other people starting careers in public service. He has mentored countless people who have gone to be great successes in the San Diego community. Perhaps most striking was Murray's deep care for the city of San Diego and how translated that into political and charitable action. Murray was not involved in politics to be a power broker or to push an ambitious partisan agenda. Murray wanted to support whoever he thought would make the city stronger for the long haul. He really cared who was in office and supported people from the very beginning. He was a leading Democrat but he crossed the aisle and supported Republicans when he thought that was the right thing to do. Murray was such a great listener. And he was supportive and insightful. And he was funny. He was warm and witty and never shy about telling it like it is. I never had a conversation with Murray that I didn't walk away from feeling generally better. Originally from Minnesota, Murray never lost his Midwestern sensibility.

199,NY.CLARKE,NY,Clarke,"Mr. Speaker, as we start the 113th Congress, I am honored to once again join my colleagues in serving the American people--especially my constituents in the Ninth District of New York. We have an opportunity to look forward, to end the partisanship that has undermined efforts to secure our future as a nation.
I am disappointed to say that I can hardly imagine a worse end to a session of Congress than the one we have just witnessed. In our labored efforts to avoid a disastrous tumble over the ``fiscal cliff,'' we lost sight of a far less figurative disaster.
The families harmed by Hurricane Sandy--those people whose homes and businesses were threatened by the storm--have the right to demand action from this Congress. Yet, this Congress was unable to enact a proposal for relief, to provide the assistance people need to start the recovery. I call on my colleagues to support emergency supplemental appropriations for areas affected by Hurricane Sandy.
Fixing the mistakes of yesterday, however, will be only part of the solution. We have a more important responsibility in this 113th Congress--to demonstrate to the American people that these failures were not examples of a serious problem within the Congress itself that prevents us from working with each other to fulfill our responsibilities.
We have opportunities in this session of Congress to work together, as Democrats and Republicans, but more importantly, as Americans, to resolve the issues that are important to people in every community in this nation. As the tragedy in Newtown demonstrated, we must enact gun control laws that prevent mass murder and re-institute the ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We must end gun trafficking.
It is my hope that we address immigration reform, specifically the enactment of the DREAM Act. This act, which provides legal status and a path to citizenship to undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as minors, will benefit every person in our society. This act will allow millions of young Americans to participate in our economy, our system of higher education, and the society more generally.
Other legislation of importance that must be addressed immediately is the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, the Farm Bill, postal reform, cybersecurity, and sequestration legislation.
Let us come together, in this 113th Congress, to fulfill our duties as representatives of the people of the United States. Let us establish the foundations of a prosperity shared by every family in this nation, security from the threat of natural disasters and acts of terrorism, and a political process of which the American people are proud.",NY,CLARKE,-0.553,D,mr speaker start 113th congress honor join colleagu serv american peopleespeci constitu ninth district new york opportun look forward end partisanship undermin effort secur futur nation disappoint say hardli imagin wors end session congress one wit labor effort avoid disastr tumbl fiscal cliff lost sight far less figur disast famili harm hurrican sandythos peopl whose home busi threaten stormhav right demand action congress yet congress unabl enact propos relief provid assist peopl need start recoveri call colleagu support emerg supplement appropri area affect hurrican sandi fix mistak yesterday howev part solut import respons 113th congressto demonstr american peopl failur exampl seriou problem within congress prevent us work fulfil respons opportun session congress work togeth democrat republican importantli american resolv issu import peopl everi commun nation tragedi newtown demonstr must enact gun control law prevent mass murder reinstitut ban assault weapon highcapac magazin must end gun traffick hope address immigr reform specif enact dream act act provid legal statu path citizenship undocu immigr arriv unit state minor benefit everi person societi act allow million young american particip economi system higher educ societi gener legisl import must address immedi reauthor violenc women act farm bill postal reform cybersecur sequestr legisl let us come togeth 113th congress fulfil duti repres peopl unit state let us establish foundat prosper share everi famili nation secur threat natur disast act terror polit process american peopl proud
200,MA.CAPUANO,MA,Capuano,"Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory and the heroic example of Rita Levi-Montalcini, Nobel Laureate in Medicine and Senator-for-Life of the Republic of Italy. My constituents in our district's universities, research institutes and teaching hospitals join me in this homage. Dr. Allen Mitchell, Professor of Epidemiology and Pediatrics at Boston University, studied with her and with her mentor, Victor Hamburger. Everyone, he remembered, recognized the ``enormity of her contributions.'' ``But,'' he continued, ``those of us privileged to interact directly with her saw Dr. Rita Levi-Montalcini as a role model who combined scientific passion and rigor with a great sense of humanity.''
Edward A. Kravitz, George Packer Berry Professor of Neurobiology at the Harvard Medical School recalled that Dr. Levi-Montalcini was unfailingly kind and gracious to young researchers, welcoming them to her lab and her circle of distinguished colleagues. He was touched by her warmth and inspired by her eagerness always to know more.
Rita Levi-Montalcini was born in Turin in 1909, one of four children of an educated family, her father an engineer and mathematician, her mother, like her twin sister Paola, a gifted painter. The arts were thought appropriate pastimes for young ladies, but science was not, and her first struggle was convincing her father to let her study medicine. She graduated, summa cum laude, in Medicine and Surgery in 1936 and began a specialization in neurology and psychiatry. Two years later, Mussolini promulgated racial laws based on those already in effect in Nazi Germany, barring Jews from universities. Rita Levi-Montalcini's second and most remarkable struggle was to continue her research alone and in secret. She cultivated chick embryos in her bedroom and studied them closely. Her inspiration, she always acknowledged, came from a paper by Victor Hamburger, pioneer of experimental embryology. Hamburger, like many of the most prominent German and Italian scientists, was at that time already in the United States. She chose to remain in Italy, confident that her country would return to its democratic principles. She was associated with the struggle for Liberation and, in the time of greatest danger, moved her laboratory into the countryside where she and her family found refuge. When Florence was freed, she practiced medicine, for the only time in her life, among refugees fleeing the fighting that still raged in northern Italy.
After the war, Dr. Levi-Montalcini joined Hamburger at Washington University in St. Louis. There began her collaboration with Dr. Stanley Cohen with whom she shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1986. Together they studied the biochemistry of nerve growth and revolutionized the study of cell growth and development.

202,CA.COSTA,CA,Costa,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel Sami D. Said for his many years of dedication and service to the United States. After almost two years of serving as Commander for the 144th Fighter Wing, California Air National Guard, Colonel Said will be promoted to the rank of Brigadier General and will serve a tour in Afghanistan.
Colonel Said has devoted his life to serving the United States. He began his career in 1991 at the 159th Fighter Squadron in Jacksonville, Florida where he was a Pilot Trainee and then an F-16 Fighter Pilot. Colonel Said held other duties at the 159th Fighter Squadron, including Chief of Standardization and Evaluation, Instructor Pilot, Weapons Officer, and Squadron Operations Officer.
In June 2003, Colonel Said completed his time with the 159th Fighter Squadron and went on to become the Commander of the 125th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron. He was also the Wing Special Projects Officer (ORI) and the Chief of Wing Operations for the 125th Fighter Wing. After spending two years with the 125th Fighter Wing, Colonel Said served as a National Security Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School of Government.
Colonel Said worked in Washington, DC, for three years serving at the Pentagon from 2008 to 2011. He worked in the Office of the Secretary of Defense as a Military Assistant to the Department of Defense Transition Team and Chief of Staff/Senior Military Assistant to the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.
Along with his vast experience and knowledge, Colonel Said has received numerous awards and decorations. These include the Defense Superior Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, Combat Readiness Medal with five oak leaf clusters, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.
In April 2011, Colonel Said became the Commander for the 144th Fighter Wing in Fresno, California. While he was in Fresno for a short period of time, our community benefited from his time here. We will be sad to see him go. As he moves on to proudly serve our country overseas in Afghanistan, Colonel Said's expertise and many years of experience will be greatly missed at the 144th Fighter Wing.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Colonel Sami Said on his upcoming promotion to the rank of Brigadier General and wish him well in his next tour of service.

204,MI.MILLER,MI,Miller,"Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay tribute to the memory of a great citizen of the State of Michigan, the late Dr. Sheldon Kapen. Sadly, Dr. Kapen passed away on Thanksgiving Day at the age of 77.
He was the longtime Chairman of the Department of Neurology at the John V. Dingell Veterans Administration Hospital in Detroit and a leading figure in the field of sleep disorders research who made many outstanding discoveries and contributions. The plaque which honors him at the VA hospital calls Dr. Kapen ``A Physician, a teacher, a scientist, a leader, and a friend''.
My sincerest condolences go out to his family. I would like to place into the Record an article from the VA Hospital bulletin on the occasion of the naming of the Sheldon Kapen Sleep Laboratory last year as well as an obituary that appeared in the Wayne State University newspaper.
This fall, the Detroit VAMC staff and patients paid tribute to one of its long-time physicians, hanging a plaque in his honor in the sleep clinic. Dr. Sheldon Kapen's legacy is represented in the sleep lab, which he founded in 1985, when he took over a new 2 bed unit in the old Detroit VAMC in Allen Park. Dr. Kapen started the first sleep lab in any VA facility. Dr. Kapen achieved many successes over the years. Among the grants he won, Dr. Kapen received a VA Research Grant to study stroke and sleep. When the Detroit VA Medical Center moved to Detroit and became the John D. Dingell VA Medical Center, Dr. Kapen was able to expand the clinic into a new 8 bed facility with state of the art equipment and more staff. Dr. Kapen's sleep medicine and laboratory was the first VA sleep lab to be accredited, and approximately the 20th in the nation (there are now about 1,000 accredited sleep labs in the U.S.). He also had the first VA-based accredited fellowship program in 1989 (the 4th overall in the country) and it has also been reaccredited multiple times. In his more than 30 years with the VA, Dr. Kapen has trained dozens of physicians, and continues to train and supervise sleep fellows from Wayne State University.",MI,MILLER,0.727,R,mr speaker would like pay tribut memori great citizen state michigan late dr sheldon kapen sadli dr kapen pass away thanksgiv day age 77 longtim chairman depart neurolog john v dingel veteran administr hospit detroit lead figur field sleep disord research made mani outstand discoveri contribut plaqu honor va hospit call dr kapen physician teacher scientist leader friend sincerest condol go famili would like place record articl va hospit bulletin occas name sheldon kapen sleep laboratori last year well obituari appear wayn state univers newspap fall detroit vamc staff patient paid tribut one longtim physician hang plaqu honor sleep clinic dr sheldon kapen legaci repres sleep lab found 1985 took new 2 bed unit old detroit vamc allen park dr kapen start first sleep lab va facil dr kapen achiev mani success year among grant won dr kapen receiv va research grant studi stroke sleep detroit va medic center move detroit becam john d dingel va medic center dr kapen abl expand clinic new 8 bed facil state art equip staff dr kapen sleep medicin laboratori first va sleep lab accredit approxim 20th nation 1 000 accredit sleep lab u also first vabas accredit fellowship program 1989 4th overal countri also reaccredit multipl time 30 year va dr kapen train dozen physician continu train supervis sleep fellow wayn state univers

Carol's dedication to people and service was apparent in her extensive achievements and contributions to our State. She began her career working in shelters in many of the largest communities across the State. Displaying a knack for leadership and an entrepreneurial spirit, Carol moved on to the Connecticut Aids Resource Coalition where she founded the National Working Positive Coalition. She became director of CCEH in 2006.
While heading the Coalition, she helped institute greater coordination of services among nonprofits, managed the annual Point-In-Time homeless census, and led the State in rapid re-housing and shelter diversion strategies. Carol's years of dedication and tireless hard work impacted countless lives across our State. Due in large degree to Carol's leadership statewide, there has been historic progress made in the effort to combat homelessness in Connecticut's Second Congressional District.
Carol's passing marks an irreplaceable loss for our community, for the fight against homelessness, and the battle to provide justice for underserved communities.

208,CT.LARSON,CT,Larson,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Carol Walter, a fierce advocate for the homeless in Connecticut, who passed away on December 27, 2012. Carol served as the Executive Director of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness and dedicated her life's work to fighting homelessness and its contributing causes.
Her passion, energy, and persistent focus on finding solutions helped countless individuals and families across our State. For all those who knew her, worked with her, and benefited from her good works--we are saddened by this loss and offer our deepest condolences to her family.
While many in the community will pay tribute to Carol Walter, I would like to submit the following article from The Hartford Courant that captures her dynamic spirit:
 Vibrant Advocate for the Homeless, Carol Walter, Dies at 53
Carol Walter, the executive director of Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, was remembered by her friends Friday as a quick-witted, energetic leader and unwavering advocate for the homeless. Walter, 53, died Thursday after a short battle with lung cancer, friends said. When Walter became executive director in 2006, friends said, she had landed her dream job. Walter was passionate about creating long-term solutions to homelessness, including permanent housing and supportive services. ``Beyond shelters and short-gap solutions, she was very interested in finding longer-term solutions, particularly in reducing chronic homelessness,'' said Mercedes Soto, who served on CCEH's board of directors from 2009 to 2012. ``She was able to rally an entire spectrum of people to work toward these goals, and worked to get people housed as quickly as possible. ``She was a dynamo. She made a big impact on me and everyone who knew her.'' Colleagues at CCEH said Walter presided over ``a sea change'' in the organization's approach to homelessness, including greater coordination of services among other nonprofits and oversight of the coalition's statewide ``point in time'' homeless consensus. She also led efforts in rapid re-housing and shelter diversion strategies, they said. ``People often tell me how energetic I am,'' said Shawn Lang, a longtime friend of Walter. ``I tell them, `go hang around with Carol for a while, she'll make me look like a slug.' She had great passion for her work. Her enthusiasm and her energy and smarts opened a lot of doors.'' Prior to her position at CCEH, Walter worked at homeless shelters in New Haven, Hartford and Stamford, friends said. She also worked at the Connecticut AIDS Resource Coalition as a membership services coordinator, where she helped people with AIDS find employment. Walter was active in her work, sometimes to the point that she couldn't sit still. ``She had more energy than 10 of us,'' said Dave Martineau, vice president of CCEH's board of directors and a friend of Walter. ``She always used to say, `I have no time. I'm trying to end homelessness.' She gave her whole life to it.'' ``She was a woman who could never stand still,'' added Jose Vega, program manager for the McKinney homeless shelter in Hartford, who had worked with Walter. ``She was a fighter, and such a strong advocate for this community. She touched so many lives.'' Howard Rifkin, executive director of Partnership for Strong Communities, an organization that seeks to end homelessness and create affordable housing opportunities, recalled Walter as ``maddening and endearing at the same time.'' Rifkin collaborated with Walter on several initiatives, including a plan to end chronic homelessness and homelessness among veterans and families with children in Connecticut. ``We're both opinionated people,'' he said. ``She and I would sometimes go at it, but we would always end our meetings with a hug and a laugh.'' Rifkin said Walter had ``a sense of urgency'' about her work. ``She had a deep, deep commitment to [creating] a more equitable and socially just society, and I'm sure that her passion for this work was informed by that,'' he said. Outside of work, Walter was an avid theater-goer, friends said. She loved the outdoors, traveling and being near the ocean. She was also a devoted Mets fan. ``Carol would put a Yankees cap in her freezer to give the Mets good luck,'' Lang said. ``If that didn't work, we'd change the places we were sitting. There were a lot of crazy rituals around baseball games.'' Lang said Walter's friends and colleagues would miss the woman who had ``a real zest for life.'' ``Connecticut is a little smaller and a little darker today,'' she said.

209,VA.WITTMAN,VA,Wittman,"Mr. Speaker, as the 113th Congress begins, I strongly believe that no Member of Congress should have his or her salary increased. It is critical that this nation's elected leaders lead by example in the quest to reduce our debt and put this nation on sound financial footing. Responsible, accountable leadership is required in Washington if this train of fiscal disaster is ever going to get rerouted onto a track toward prosperity and economic growth. That is why I am a cosponsor of legislation that would halt the pay increase for Members of Congress under the President's December 27, 2012 Executive Order and legislation to stop the a utomatic pay increase for members of Congress. However, I also want to make absolutely clear my opposition to any efforts to unfairly target our civilian federal workforce for deficit reduction purposes. America's First District is full of hardworking and dedicated citizens who serve the people of this nation every day, such as on the front lines of the War on Terror or in support roles for our military. Still others provide valuable service at places like VA hospitals, cancer research laboratories, and the FBI. And yet since 2010, federal civilian employees have seen their pay frozen and their benefits reduced on multiple occasions. I voted against the initial two-year pay freeze in December of 2010, and on the first day of 2013, I voted against H.R. 6726, which would have extended this pay freeze for an additional year. I am fully ready and willing to cut my own salary, benefits, and office budget, but we must stop singling out federal employees simply because Congress fails to address the out-of-control spending. There is no question that our nation must get its spending in order, and federal employees are certainly eager to do their part to help in this effort. Their daily contributions to their fellow citizens and to the cause of freedom are simply innumerable, and yet during the deficit reduction debate over the last few years, federal employees have been asked to contribute more than their fair share. Our federal civilian employees live a life of selfless service, and they deserve our appreciation. I am hopeful that deficit reduction efforts going forward will focus more realistically on addressing the true drivers of our debt, rather than targeting those who are trying simply to serve their nation each and every day.",VA,WITTMAN,0.676,R,mr speaker 113th congress begin strongli believ member congress salari increas critic nation elect leader lead exampl quest reduc debt put nation sound financi foot respons account leadership requir washington train fiscal disast ever go get rerout onto track toward prosper econom growth cosponsor legisl would halt pay increas member congress presid decemb 27 2012 execut order legisl stop utomat pay increas member congress howev also want make absolut clear opposit effort unfairli target civilian feder workforc deficit reduct purpos america first district full hardwork dedic citizen serv peopl nation everi day front line war terror support role militari still other provid valuabl servic place like va hospit cancer research laboratori fbi yet sinc 2010 feder civilian employe seen pay frozen benefit reduc multipl occas vote initi twoyear pay freez decemb 2010 first day 2013 vote h r 6726 would extend pay freez addit year fulli readi will cut salari benefit offic budget must stop singl feder employe simpli congress fail address outofcontrol spend question nation must get spend order feder employe certainli eager part help effort daili contribut fellow citizen caus freedom simpli innumer yet deficit reduct debat last year feder employe ask contribut fair share feder civilian employe live life selfless servic deserv appreci hope deficit reduct effort go forward focu realist address true driver debt rather target tri simpli serv nation everi day
210,IL.RUSH,IL,Rush,"Mr. Speaker, it is New Years 2013. The Nation now finds itself at an urgent crossroads.
America has fallen over the fiscal cliff. Many of our fellow and most economically vulnerable Americans are now in a free fall. How far they fall and for how long will be up to Congress.
The House of Representatives should be deciding now, and by that I mean today, whether to pass the Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act of 2012, which was passed in the Senate by an overwhelming bipartisan 89-8 vote.
If the House of Representatives fumbles this opportunity, it won't matter to these Americans which political party tells them that they did or did not cut taxes, or which party held more closely to its campaign promises.
What matters to the 2 million Americans who are currently unemployed is why are their unemployment benefits being held hostage to provide tax cuts for employed and more well-off Americans?
The deal agreed to in the Senate provides a strong enough platform for our country's continued progress and economic recovery. That package will generate a good deal of the increased tax revenues that our U.S. Treasury needs to operate the government.
The Senate's package assures millions of students and unemployed and poor Americans that they will have the basics to carry out their daily lives and to advance their educational and career goals. Among other things, the Senate deal would also authorize the Farm Bill through September of this year.
Extending earned income and child care tax credits and benefits, as the Senate deal would do, may not mean much for middle class families and individuals. But guess what? Those credits and benefits are hugely important, for example, to a family of four under the poverty level, which on average makes only $21,000 per year.
The Senate's proposal, which the Majority should bring up immediately for a vote is a good compromise. It won't give Republicans everything that they want. Similarly, Democrats are not getting all of what they want in this package.
And rightly so--neither party has all the answers to the plethora of very complex fiscal problems we are facing. Compromise is the solution, just as compromise will be the solution when we come up against sequestration, the debt ceiling, and passing a continuing budget resolution.
I strongly urged you, Mr. Speaker, to call up H.R. 8, the Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act, as amended and passed by the Senate for a vote in this House. Let's stop dangling innocent and vulnerable Americans over the fiscal cliff; they've waited too long for us to act as it is.",IL,RUSH,-0.386,D,mr speaker new year 2013 nation find urgent crossroad america fallen fiscal cliff mani fellow econom vulner american free fall far fall long congress hous repres decid mean today whether pass job protect recess prevent act 2012 pass senat overwhelm bipartisan 898 vote hous repres fumbl opportun wont matter american polit parti tell cut tax parti held close campaign promis matter 2 million american current unemploy unemploy benefit held hostag provid tax cut employ welloff american deal agre senat provid strong enough platform countri continu progress econom recoveri packag gener good deal increas tax revenu u treasuri need oper govern senat packag assur million student unemploy poor american basic carri daili live advanc educ career goal among thing senat deal would also author farm bill septemb year extend earn incom child care tax credit benefit senat deal would may mean much middl class famili individu guess credit benefit huge import exampl famili four poverti level averag make 21 000 per year senat propos major bring immedi vote good compromis wont give republican everyth want similarli democrat get want packag rightli soneith parti answer plethora complex fiscal problem face compromis solut compromis solut come sequestr debt ceil pass continu budget resolut strongli urg mr speaker call h r 8 job protect recess prevent act amend pass senat vote hous let stop dangl innoc vulner american fiscal cliff theyv wait long us act
211,CA.CALVERT,CA,Calvert,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Thomas Opitz. Tom passed away on Saturday, December 29, 2012. A long time resident of Corona, he was a pillar of the community and he will be deeply missed.
Tom was born November 21, 1922, in La Crosse, Wisconsin, the son of Raymond J. and Susan (Singer) Opitz. He served his country honorably in World War II in the United States Army Air Corps from 1944-1946 and received several medals in recognition of his military achievements. He was a member of the Navy League, the Elks and the Confederate Air Force.
Tom worked as a self employed contractor, interior designer and artist of restaurants. Over the years, the Opitz family and the Calvert family have had a close relationship, both personal and professional, and Tom was a great partner and friend. He and his family helped our family build the Corona Bowl, the Encore, Lord Calvert's Jolly Fox and the Jolly Fox Pub & Grille. Millions of Californians have enjoyed a family dinner in restaurants designed by Tom, as he built, designed, and painted over 400.
Tom was a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He is survived by his sons Craig, Thomas, Mark and daughter Christal Trusty; 11 grandchildren; and 6 great-grandchildren. On Monday, January 7, 2013, a memorial service honoring Tom's extraordinary life will be held at Thomas Miller Mortuary in Corona. He will be interred at the Riverside National Cemetery, where he will be laid to rest with his wife of 58 years, Ruth Opitz.
Tom will always be remembered for his devotion to family, caring nature and selfless giving. Tom demonstrated an incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. These achievements and qualities are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Tom's family and friends.

214,SC.WILSON,SC,Wilson,"Madam Speaker, the start of a new congressional term brings tremendous opportunity for House Republicans to lead our Nation on a path to prosperity. Last week, I held three press conferences across the Second Congressional District of South Carolina from West Columbia to Aiken, North Augusta, and unveiled an agenda for this year.
For the past 4 years, our unemployment rate has averaged above 8 percent, the highest on record since the Great Depression. I look forward to continue working with House Republicans to encourage job creation through economic growth.
Additionally, Congress must limit Washington's out-of-control spending and reduce our $16 trillion debt to protect the value of the dollar for senior citizens and so that future generations do not endure the burden of higher taxes.

There is a medical device tax that started on January 1 of 2.3 percent on gross sales. This means some of our smallest companies, medical start-up companies, are going to pay a tax not on profits but their gross receipts.
The flexible spending account that many families rely upon to pay for recurring expenses with pre-tax dollars, especially those families with special needs children, those are now capped at $2,500.
Investment income, a surtax of 3.8 percent for people who earn above a certain level.
Taxes on medical deductions, it rises from a 7.5 percent reduction to 10 percent on adjusted gross income. That means our sickest constituents are going to be paying more taxes.
And then, finally, the Medicare payroll tax hike. For the first time, individuals who earn investment income are going to be paying a payroll tax of .9 percent. There will be an additional .9 percent on other income as well.

This was at the height of the war in Vietnam and wounded soldiers were arriving at the hospital daily. Most were amputees who had lost their legs to mines and booby traps.
Sadly, as America became increasingly divided over the war in Vietnam they also became divided over their support for those who fought in that war. As a result, these wounded soldiers were unappreciated, isolated, and largely forgotten. To make matters worse, after they were stabilized, they were sent for their rehabilitation to VA facilities that were often substandard.
I look forward to using my new leadership position as the chairman for the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs to help all veterans who have served our country and have earned our support.

But most citizens don't have government guards protecting them 24/7. Many people feel defenseless. Some people of this Chamber expect protection for themselves while advocating more restrictions on guns for the people of America--hypocrisy at its highest. In fact, one of the proposals for more gun laws mirrors the stringent D.C. gun laws. If the D.C. gun laws worked, D.C. would not be such a violent city. If D.C. gun laws worked, why do we have so many armed guards at the Capitol?
The elites forget it's the shooter, not the gun. They want more government power and control while taking away liberty from the rest of us.

The battle to protect the Second Amendment rights of all citizens rages on in Congress, and this is the appropriate place for such debate--not in the dark of night through executive orders as the Obama administration has become so fond of doing.
Gun control advocates prey on the fears of Americans, claiming that stricter gun laws will result in reduced gun violence. That theory is false and is dangerous to the sanctity of the United States Constitution. Security can only come through the preservation of individual liberties such as the right to defend one's home and one's family. We should protect the right to keep and bear arms as fiercely as we seek to protect the rights of free speech, the freedom of religion, and of due process.

On the morning of December 29, 2012, Ripley's Mayor received an anonymous letter detailing a heroic event that happened the week earlier, just before the Christmas holiday. The letter's anonymous author had been traveling down Route 33 when he witnessed a frightening car wreck, in which the vehicle left the road and landed in the frigid waters of a nearby creek.
The first emergency responder on the scene was a man from the fire department, who, according to the anonymous author, waded into the cold waters without hesitation to help the trapped motorist. The fireman successfully retrieved the elderly man from his almost completely submerged car and helped him to shore, reassuring him along the way that everything would be alright. By the time the fireman helped the elderly man to the creek bank, other members of the fire department, paramedics, and police had arrived on the scene to assist.
Once the elderly man was safe from the frigid waters and receiving medical treatment from paramedics, the letter's anonymous author asked a member of the fire department for the name of the fireman that risked hypothermia to save the motorist. The fireman responded, ``That's our chief!'' It was Ripley's volunteer fire chief, Richard Gobble, who had rescued the man from the frozen creek and saved his life.

Betty was a woman of many trades. She served as a first grade teacher in Caruthers, California and operated a dress shop in the Fig Garden Shopping Center in Fresno, California. With her background as an educator and small business owner, Betty successfully ran for the Fresno County Board of Supervisors in 1983. Betty served the third supervisorial district for five years.
Betty's progressive ideas along with her ability to get things done made her a well-respected political mind in California's San Joaquin Valley. Aspiring political candidates would often reach out to Betty first when running for office. Betty and her husband, Richard, were a formidable team--especially when it came to organizing campaigns and winning elections.
Along with being a political trailblazer, Betty was also a wonderful wife, mother, and grandmother. Betty's family was everything to her. She was a caregiver for a majority of her life--providing for her disabled son, Eric, for over 50 years, and caring for Richard after his stroke. Betty truly understood the importance of love and family.

235,MN.MCCOLLUM,MN,McCollum,"Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to the unique history of the Saint Paul Curling Club on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the organization. Since 1912, the club has called Selby Avenue in Saint Paul, Minnesota its home. Today, it is the largest curling club in the United States with more than 1,200 members.
The sport of curling has a deep and rich history in Minnesota's capital city. In 1885 two clubs formed under the names of the Saint Paul Curling Club and the Nushka Curling Club. The first games were played on the frozen Mississippi River near Raspberry Island in downtown St. Paul. In 1904 the first Saint Paul Curling Club closed and the Capitol City Curling Club was formed the following year. In 1912 the Capitol City and Nushka Curling Clubs merged to form the current Saint Paul Curling Club and the new club took up residence in its current home on Selby Avenue.
During its century on Selby Avenue, the Saint Paul Curling Club has witnessed many changes--seasonal outdoor ice sheets have been upgraded to year round indoor refrigerated rinks; financial woes and declining membership in past decades have given way to booming times and a surge in membership; and a neighborhood in decline has been reborn. Throughout all these changes and more, the Saint Paul Curling Club has remained at 470 Selby Avenue. It has not only survived, it has invested in painstaking restoration as well as expansion of its historic home. Throughout its history on Selby Avenue, the Saint Paul Curling Club has served as a foundation for this neighborhood, which is once again a thriving residential community and bustling destination for dining, shopping, and socializing.
Central to the Saint Paul Curling Club is the sport of curling. Not only is it the largest curling club in the U.S., it has frequently played host to both national and international competitions. The club has hosted numerous bonspiel's, which are curling tournaments, and in 1988 they hosted the USCA Men's Championship. The club is also home to former Olympians from the 2010 Vancouver games, John Benton and Allison Pottinger. The club has helped bring recognition and respect to the City of Saint Paul.

Ms. McCollum began her service as a Clerk Typist, GS-1, at the Soldier Support Center-National Capital Region. In 1989, she went on to serve as a secretary and Congressional Liaison Clerk for the 6th Infantry Division (Light), Fort Wainwright, Alaska. When she returned to Washington, DC in 1992, she briefly worked for the Acquisition Management Branch, U.S. Total Army Personnel Command, before accepting a position in the Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison (OCLL), Congressional Inquiry Division. During this time, Ms. McCollum was assigned to ever higher levels of responsibility as her experience and reputation as a skilled action officer grew.
Ms. McCollum received a promotion in the Congressional Activities Division, where she was responsible for ensuring that Army Senior Leader written testimony was provided to the Defense Oversight committees in a timely manner. She published a key tool for the Army in responding to Congress: the Congressional Actions Responsibilities Standard Operating Procedures. Within a year, she was promoted again and asked to become the Legislative Assistant to Sergeant Major of the Army Kenneth Preston, becoming his sole advisor for all congressional affairs matters. In that role, Ms. McCollum was responsible for preparing the SMA for congressional testimony, providing analysis on Congressional interest items and legislation related to Soldier and Family issues, and keeping him informed on Members and Staff in preparation for numerous Congressional office calls, events, and trips. This was critical to ensure he was able to provide Members of Congress and their Staff with the most current information on Army Programs. Ms. McCollum most recently served as the Deputy Chief of Support Operations Division, Army Legislative Liaison.
Ms. McCollum has continued to remain passionate about Soldiers, their Families, and ensuring the quality of life for Service Members matches the quality of their service.

241,TX.BURGESS,TX,Burgess,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the City of Highland Village as they celebrate their 50th Anniversary as an incorporated city.
Highland Village was voted into existence by approximately 100 residents on February 14, 1963, with 53 supporting votes and seven opposed. Over the subsequent 50 years the 5.5 square-mile city has transitioned from a small population and weekenders from Dallas to the lakeside community that is now home for almost 16,000 permanent residents.
Highland Village has a long history that includes its role as a hideout in the 1870s for the notorious highwayman, Sam Bass, who was drawn to the privacy of the trees and hills that are unique to much of north Texas. The same natural beauty that attracted the infamous also beckoned wealthy Dallasites seeking respite from the city. The growth continued and development by groups such as Mobil Land Development Corporation transformed the small, rural town into a suburban city in the 1970s. It eventually became a Home Rule City in 1986 as its population surpassed 5,000.
Residential expansion led to improvements in infrastructure and economic growth. Diversification of the community's revenue base through commercial development led to the city's current vibrant retail market. Roadway improvements to FM 407 and the extension of FM 2499 as a major north south route which will eventually connect DFW Airport with Denton residents has also fostered the community's prosperity. Managing its growth in a conservatively fiscal manner, Highland Village prioritized services that would enhance and preserve the quality of life for residents. As a result, current residents enjoy living in a municipality identified as the ``Safest City in Texas'', with full-time fire and emergency services, an extensive system of community trails and membership in the Denton County Transportation Authority with nearby rail connectivity to the international commerce hub of Dallas.
As Highland Village celebrates their 50th anniversary, I salute the unique community that I and my family have also known as home. It is my privilege today to represent the City of Highland Village and its residents in the U.S. House of Representatives.",TX,BURGESS,1.027,R,mr speaker rise today congratul citi highland villag celebr 50th anniversari incorpor citi highland villag vote exist approxim 100 resid februari 14 1963 53 support vote seven oppos subsequ 50 year 5 5 squaremil citi transit small popul weekend dalla lakesid commun home almost 16 000 perman resid highland villag long histori includ role hideout 1870 notori highwayman sam bass drawn privaci tree hill uniqu much north texa natur beauti attract infam also beckon wealthi dallasit seek respit citi growth continu develop group mobil land develop corpor transform small rural town suburban citi 1970 eventu becam home rule citi 1986 popul surpass 5 000 residenti expans led improv infrastructur econom growth diversif commun revenu base commerci develop led citi current vibrant retail market roadway improv fm 407 extens fm 2499 major north south rout eventu connect dfw airport denton resid also foster commun prosper manag growth conserv fiscal manner highland villag priorit servic would enhanc preserv qualiti life resid result current resid enjoy live municip identifi safest citi texa fulltim fire emerg servic extens system commun trail membership denton counti transport author nearbi rail connect intern commerc hub dalla highland villag celebr 50th anniversari salut uniqu commun famili also known home privileg today repres citi highland villag resid u hous repres
242,CA.COSTA,CA,Costa,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Elaine Roscella Lehman. Her character exemplified the very best of what our Nation has to offer--she was thoughtful, generous, and possessed a strong work ethic.
Elaine's long-time commitment to service began early in her life when she joined the United States Navy and served in the WAVES (Women Accepted to Volunteer Emergency Service) division during World War II. Elaine began her service in Philadelphia as a medical operating room assistant, and she was later stationed at Pearl Harbor Navy Hospital. She served our country proudly during a time in history that forever changed our Nation and the world.
After the war ended, Elaine moved to Central California with her brothers. Shortly after arriving in the Golden State, she met her lifelong partner, Henry Lehman, and married him in 1947. Elaine and Henry had four children: Rick, Janet, David, and Charles. Together, they maintained and operated a successful family farm.
Elaine's service was not exclusive to times of war. She was also deeply involved in her community and became a well-known figure in Sanger, California and surrounding cities. She was president of Wilson Elementary School PTA, served as a Cub Scout Den Mother, and also volunteered as a Room Mother. In 1979, Elaine's work and dedication was recognized when she was honored as Sanger's Mother of the Year.
After an unfortunate automobile accident that resulted in the tragic death of her child Charlie, Elaine decided that she would go back to school for her nursing degree. She worked as an LVN at Valley Medical Center and at the Sanger Convalescent Hospital. Elaine genuinely cared for the well-being of others, so being a nurse suited her well. Elaine consistently went above and beyond for her patients. For years, she drove cancer patients to their treatments as a member of Angels on Wheels, using her own vehicle and gas. Elaine's legacy will undoubtedly live on through her kind and generous acts.
Elaine supported her family members whole-heartedly in times of distress and in times when they were working to fulfill their goals. When Henry was diagnosed with cancer, Elaine retired to stay with him and provide full-time care. When Rick ran for election in 1976, she was with him every step of the way until the end of his political career. Rick served with distinction in the California State Legislature and as a member of the House of Representatives from 1983 to 1994. Her daughter Janet served as a teacher, while her son David works as a structural engineer.
In addition to her family, Elaine's faith was also extremely important to her, and she taught Sunday school for over 20 years. She leaves behind her three children and two grandchildren: Carrie Beedle and Stephanie Lehman.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pay tribute to the life of an amazing woman, Elaine Roscella Lehman.

246,CA.HAHN,CA,Hahn,"Mr. Speaker, last week, California lost one of its most beloved individuals, Huell Howser. Huell was known to so many Californians as the friendly host of California's Gold, the long running public television program from which he retired late last year.
Huell's southern accent made it clear that he wasn't a native Californian. He was born in Tennessee but moved to Los Angeles in 1981 to become a reporter for KCBS. He fell in love with his new home and created his own television show dedicated to life in California. The premise was simple. He, a cameraman, and a hand-held microphone traveled across the state, visiting everything from national parks to little known mom-and-pop shops, in search of California stories. He found them.
His folksy charm was disarming and his impromptu interviews were lighthearted and friendly. He talked to nearly everyone he met and found the most incredible stories ranging from tragic and touching to obscure and wonderful. But regardless of where he was visiting, his genuine enthusiasm stole the show. He was known for his ``gee-wiz'' demeanor and being completely fascinated with everything he stumbled upon, often exclaiming ``That's amazing!'' The LA Times once called him ``magnificently unslick.'' Many Californians have mastered their own impression of him, with love of course.
California's Gold ran on public television for 19 years. It became many Californians' ``comfort television.'' Huell Howser was always a pleasure to watch. Each episode would show you everything you ever wanted to know about a place, and perhaps a little more.
He was a personal friend and I will always have fond memories of our Thanksgivings together at my brother Jim's home in San Pedro. I will never forget listening to Huell and my mother Ramona share stories of Nashville where she attended high school.
Since his passing, there has been an outpouring of tributes from his fans across the state who remember him for his optimism and sincerity.

Ms. Pablo began her service in the Pentagon in 1985 with the Department of the Army's Military Operations, Training Directorate. She relocated to Guam in 1986 as part of her husband's military reassignment where she worked for the Naval Supply Depot from 1986-1988. Mrs. Pablo returned to the Washington, DC area in 1988 where she began her 24-year tenure with the Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison in the Congressional Travel Office as a Travel Staff Assistant. During this time, Ms. Pablo coordinated and arranged travel for Members and employees of Congress averaging 450 Congressional trips annually. She played a key role and contributed to several successful and flawless missions.
In 2002, Ms. Pablo became the Chief of the Army Congressional Travel Office where she served as the Army's subject matter expert on Congressional travel and was responsible for the administration and management of the Army's Congressional Travel Program. Her expertise and selfless dedication to Congress and the Army ensured support and assistance for delegations traveling domestic and abroad, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Ms. Pablo was always willing to do whatever it took to accomplish the missions vital to Congress and the Army.

249,KY.ROGERS,KY,Rogers,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of my dearest friends and a jewel of southern Kentucky, the late Helen Hansford.
Helen was a staunch Republican since the day she was old enough to officially register, at the age of 21. From then on, she stood firm on conservative principles with her sweet southern charm. Helen became a member of the Republican Women's Club in 1966, served as an executive committee member of Kentucky's Republican Party for more than 20 years, and attended every Republican National Convention since 1984, until news of a malignant brain tumor interrupted her plans in 2011.
Helen's husband, the late Sherman Hansford, served as Pulaski County Sheriff for many years. During his service, Helen was right by Sherman's side, serving as a deputy sheriff and office clerk. She had a passion for public service and believed in being a part of transforming her hometown and helping others succeed. In fact, Helen's heartbeat raced for the children in Pulaski County Schools. As the Executive Assistant to the Pulaski County Schools Superintendent and a member of the Pulaski County Board of Education, Helen never hesitated to take on the reins of responsibility when action was needed. Yet, she was always a true lady, winning over hearts with her generous spirit and words of encouragement.
When Helen believed in a cause, she invested herself into its success with every ounce of energy she had to offer. She devoted more than 50 years to numerous boards and agencies, including the Order of the Eastern Star, Kentucky Public Retirees, along with local, state and national Republican politics. In honor of her tireless dedication, Helen was recently inducted into the Pulaski County Lincoln Club Hall of Fame and the Republican 5th District Hall of Fame.

250,CA.FARR,CA,Farr,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of a remarkable mother, wife, friend, and public servant. Charlotte Ellsworth passed away just before Christmas. I had the great fortune of meeting her through her work at the Fort Ord Reuse Authority, where I often encountered her during meetings or events related to the reuse of Fort Ord. At FORA, Charlotte was the ever present cheerful voice on the phone or steady presence at sometimes heated public meetings. I know that all of us who have worked with FORA, either as community leaders, members of the public, or her colleagues, will miss her very much.
Charlotte was born in Carmel, California, on January 5, 1953. Her family lived in Seaside, California, at the time, but moved to nearby Prunedale in 1954. Her father was a painter and foreman of a glass shop on Fort Ord and was eventually promoted as Engineer of the Presidio of Monterey. She attended Echo Valley Elementary School in Prunedale and graduated from Watsonville High School in the class of 1970.
Charlotte was a lifelong member of the Las Lomas Full Gospel Church in Watsonville, where she married Kenneth Ellsworth, a soldier at Fort Ord, in 1974. In 1975, Charlotte and Ken moved to Castroville, where she lived until her passing. Charlotte and Ken welcomed a son, Kenneth Jr., in 1976. Kenneth Jr. and his wife, Edith, both serve as police officers in Salinas, California. They recently welcomed a baby girl, Alyssa, who was the light of Charlotte's life and who Ken Sr. laughingly says ``will not be a police officer.''
Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for the whole House in extending our condolences to Charlotte Ellsworth's family, friends, and colleagues. The loss of such a remarkable person is particularly painful.

251,AL.BONNER,AL,Bonner,"Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to an exceptional group of young men who, for the second year in a row, have distinguished themselves as the undisputed national champions of college football. On January 7, 2013, the University of Alabama Crimson Tide captured the BCS National Championship with a decisive 42 to 14 victory over the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame.
By clinching their third BCS national championship in four years, the Crimson Tide has cemented their place in college football history and prompted some to ask if this remarkable team might be unequalled in the storied annals of the game.
As Kevin Scarbinsky of the Birmingham News observed in a January 8 op-ed,
All the while Notre Dame was reliving history, Alabama was making it. All over the golden domes of the Fighting Irish. Only one team played like a champion Monday in the BCS National Championship Game. Only one team shook down the thunder with old-school football and woke up the echoes of the greatest dynasties in the sport. Yea Alabama. The Crimson Tide became the third program in the poll era of college football history to win a third national championship in four years by taking apart the first program to do it. The Notre Dame champions of 1946, 1947 and 1949 would appreciate the Alabama champions of 2009, 2011 and 2012 because Alabama's third title came at Notre Dame's expense, right in Notre Dame's face. Given that Alabama plays in a Southeastern Conference that's won seven straight BCS titles, in a state with a rival in Auburn that interrupted this parade with its own championship, we're witnessing the greatest run in college football history. Greater than Notre Dame in the 1940s, Alabama in the 1970s or Nebraska in the 1990s. To win it again Monday was special. To do it against Notre Dame, Alabama's historical nemesis, was memorable. To leave no doubt on the scoreboard leaves no doubt in the debate. This was history. This is a dynasty. The best we've ever seen. The best there's ever been.
Congratulations to head coach Nick Saban, and coaches Burton Burns, Mike Groh, Doug Nussmeier, Jeff Stoutland, Jeremy Pruitt, Kirby Smart, Lance Thompson, Bobby Williams, Chris Rumph, Scott Cochran, and Joe Pannunzio.

255,KY.YARMUTH,KY,Yarmuth,"Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 2013 Sugar Bowl Champion, University of Louisville Cardinals. From Muhammad Ali's opening toss, this game was destined for greatness. The Cards followed the Champ's lead by shocking the world. They became the first team in a decade to score a touchdown in the first 15 seconds of both halves en route to the biggest upset in BCS history.
Against a team averaging one turnover and holding every opponent below 30 points, the Cards forced three turnovers and reached the 30-point mark a mere 8 seconds into the second half. Facing a defense that had never allowed a touchdown pass of 15 yards or more, Cards quarterback Teddy Bridgewater completed two.
This team proves what U of L Athletic Director Tom Jurich has said for years: ``If you doubt Charlie Strong--on field or off--you're in for a surprise.''
Coach Strong dedicated the game ball to the fans, who were 30,000 strong in New Orleans. It was a fitting tribute, and I think it's safe to say Card Nation is still on a Sugar Bowl high.
This was a great triumph for the University of Louisville and a victory for our whole community. So for the city, the University of Louisville, and this outstanding Cardinal football team, I'm proud to honor the 2013 Sugar Bowl Champion Louisville Cardinals. How sweet it is!

260,IN.MESSER,IN,Messer,"Mr. Speaker, it's an honor and privilege to stand here today in what I hope to have as the first of many Special Orders that the Republican freshman class does together.
Today, we want to highlight the importance of the upcoming debt ceiling debate and the need to get serious about addressing the out-of-control spending and borrowing that is jeopardizing the American Dream for our children and grandchildren.
I'm honored to represent Indiana's Sixth Congressional District, a 19-county area of east central and southeastern Indiana that was formerly represented by now-Governor Mike Pence. My constituents work hard, play by the rules and deserve what they've earned. They should be able to keep a little more of their paychecks for things like college tuition, family vacations or to retire just a little earlier. But Washington is standing in their way.
The fundamental question that this Congress needs to answer is whether Washington should take more than it already does from these hardworking, taxpaying Americans. The answer, of course, is no. Washington doesn't tax too little; it spends too much.
One would hope that since the last Congress raised taxes to avoid falling off the fiscal cliff, everyone's attention now would turn to our biggest fiscal problem, the out-of-control spending--now 24 percent of our gross domestic product--and the explosive growth of entitlements and interest on the debt that are adding to our more-than-$16-trillion national debt and pushing us up against the debt ceiling. But, remarkably, President Obama is now calling for even more taxes, more spending and more borrowing in return for any future spending controls. He said yesterday that we can't finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone.
Simply put, the President got his tax increases in the last Congress, and it's time for this Congress to tackle Washington's spending binge.

261,IN.BROOKS,IN,Brooks,"Mr. Speaker, my message today is simple: On too many big items, Congress has been kicking the can down the road for years. It's time to supply real leadership on the most pressing challenges we face. This is the only way we can restore trust in Congress.
We are fast approaching a dead end. The Social Security Trust Fund will be bankrupt in 20 years. Medicare and Medicaid are not on a sustainable path. It is wrong for us to make promises to the American people we know we cannot keep. We must address the drivers of our debt--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--not because these programs don't have merits, and certainly not because the seniors currently benefiting from them don't deserve what they've been promised, but because real leadership isn't about making the easy choice, it's about making the right choice.
Social Security and Medicare alone account for 36 percent of our Federal spending, and both are going to keep growing because of our aging population. My friends on the other side of the aisle will talk about cutting waste, fraud, and abuse. And while I agree we must do that, we can't tell the American people that cutting and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse alone is enough to tackle the $16 trillion debt. That's not leadership.
History shows us that unless we make the hard decision to implement changes that equal real savings now, it will not happen. We cannot afford to make changes in 7, 8 or 9 years. We don't have the luxury of more time.
We're in a position to clearly see three obvious opportunities to make real, sustainable changes. First, we know we are approaching the debt ceiling. Second, sequestration will go into effect in 2 months, and third, funding for the government will expire March 27. These are opportunities to make real changes in spending.
I'm excited to be representing Indiana's Fifth District, and I'm ready to get to work. There is no reason we need to wait until the eleventh hour to start talking about the tough decisions we must make for the future of our country. It is time we commit to saving these important programs for those who need them and getting our economic house in order for the future generations of my children and my grandchildren and our country's children and grandchildren. Let's be the Congress in this 113th Congress that chose to tackle real problems rather than handing them down to our children.

263,IN.WALORSKI,IN,Walorski,"Mr. Speaker, I will remind my distinguished colleague from Indiana that Notre Dame was undefeated this year. It was a very successful season, and we'll just put that on the record.
Mr. Speaker, I am deeply humbled to represent the people of Indiana's Second Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. Today I speak for the first time before this Chamber and on their behalf.
To the hardworking Hoosier families in north central Indiana, thank you for sending me to Washington. I'm eager to work with my colleagues here to make raising a family and sending a child to college just a little bit easier.
To the small business owners in South Bend to Plymouth, please know that each day I will work tirelessly to strengthen the economy so you can employ those who want to work within our community.
To the senior citizens between La Porte and Peru, you can count on my support to restore the American Dream and ensure that America's best days are not behind her in the past, who absolutely want to put our future and our future generations on a solid concrete path.
Mr. Speaker, I want to let the people of Indiana know that in the coming weeks they'll hear many assertions in the debate over whether Congress should increase the debt ceiling. The people of Indiana deserve to hear the truth. The entire Nation deserves to hear the truth:
The truth is that, even as I speak, our national debt is spiraling out of control toward $16.5 trillion;
The truth is that the United States has not run one, not two, not three, but four consecutive trillion dollar budget deficits;
The truth is that this Federal Government is borrowing an unthinkable 46 cents for every dollar it spends, while throwing our children under the weight of the bill;
The truth is that the share of the national debt for every family in Indiana is a staggering $143,190. For every Hoosier, it's $52,737;
The truth, Mr. Speaker, is that it's time for us to stop spending money we simply do not have.
Admiral Mike Mullen, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has warned us. He said, ``the single biggest threat to our national security is our debt.''
In order to get our debt under control, we first must completely take care of our spending. As families in Indiana's Second District and all across the Nation, we have to prioritize spending, we have to create budgets and live within our means; so should this Congress of the United States.
Each day that we delay getting our fiscal house in order, we threaten the safety and well-being of those we love and care about the most. We threaten the opportunity and promise of future generations by limiting the resources we have to invest in infrastructure and education. Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, the truth is that it's time for us to stop spending money we simply do not have.
As big as our national debt may be, Americans have always been able to come together and solve big problems. I thank the good people of Indiana for electing me to listen to their needs and bring good Hoosier common sense to Washington. I look forward to working together in this Congress on their behalf and to tackling our most serious issues.

I worked with then-State Representative Walorski and Governor Daniels as a member of Indiana's General Assembly to help pass Indiana's balanced budget. We turned a $600 million deficit into a $300 million surplus in 1 year without a tax increase. There was no silver bullet. Our State's leader simply followed a principle most families already understand, that one shouldn't spend money they don't have.
It wasn't always easy, but 8 years later, we have fewer State government employees than any time since the early 1970s, yet our State is providing better services in leaner ways throughout government. As Governor Daniels has often famously said:

265,NC.PITTENGER,NC,Pittenger,"I thank my good friend from Indiana.
Mr. Speaker, in previous generations, serving as a Member of Congress was considered an honorable profession. Congressmen were held in high esteem and examples of true leadership. They were honored in books like ``Profiles in Courage.'' Sadly, we seem to have lost our way. Last week, Public Policy Polling found that only 9 percent of Americans approve of the job that Congress is doing. In my opinion, the reason no one approves of the job we're doing is that we're not doing our job.
Our Nation is in peril. We are threatened, not by a foreign tyrant, but by our own reckless spending. Just today, the Fitch Ratings agency warned that our AAA credit rating is at risk. We are on the verge of squandering everything that we have received from previous generations. Sadly, we are more likely to leave the next generation with crushing debt than we are to pass along the America we love.
My fellow Representatives, may I make a suggestion? Starting with the 113th Congress, the buck stops here. For too many years, Congress and the President have received an A in addition, but they seem to have always flunked subtraction. We must commit to bringing spending in line with revenue, to setting priorities and learning to say ``no.'' If we are to be the Congress which takes to say ``no.'' If we are to be the Congress which takes substantive action on deficit reduction, we must start with entitlements. It's the topic everyone is afraid to address, but weren't we elected to show true leadership?
Today the Fitch Ratings agency warned that our Nation's AAA credit rating is at risk if an increase in the debt ceiling doesn't also include a credible plan for deficit reduction. The Government Accountability Office has reported that government spending is on an unsustainable long-term fiscal path, with entitlements the primary culprit. The Congressional Budget Office reports that, left unchecked, the Federal entitlement programs will soon swamp the entire budget. Will entitlement reform be messy? Yes. Is it necessary? Yes. In fact, it's the only way to bring a lasting solution to our Nation's fiscal problems. 
Any plan to reform entitlements must protect the benefits promised to the current generation. But as we look to the future, we need serious reforms that will reduce spending while preserving these important safety nets for future generations.
In 2006, then-Senator Obama said:
The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.
Yet, under President Obama, we've seen record-setting deficit spending and trillions added to our national debt. The leadership failure lies with the President and others in Congress who have been unable to say ``no.''
Our objective is not arbitrary. Tax revenues are expected to remain right at the historical average of around 18 percent of the GDP. We know how much money we'll make.

267,GA.COLLINS,GA,Collins,"I thank my friend from Indiana.
It's good to be here, and it's good to get started on what we've been sent here to do. I think that's the great thing about us coming together tonight and sharing, from a freshman perspective, our first few days in which we've been thrown into a Congress that really, I don't believe, any have experienced before. There have been tough challenges, but I think this is going to be an interesting time for us all. I appreciate us getting together tonight as we go forward.
Mr. Speaker, I come from the great Georgia Ninth. The northeast Georgia district is full of mountain values and common sense. When we look at the district, as I traveled around for almost 18 months, what I kept hearing from people all along is that they wanted their life to look ahead to something of a brighter future. I think right now, from an economic perspective, when we look at what's going on, that is what they are most concerned about. They're looking at what they have at the national level and they're looking at our debt, they're looking at our economic and our budget issues and they're saying, How is this effective? How is this going to be better for my kids and my grandkids?
I thought to myself as I was traveling around and I began--when I ran, I told my constituents, I run for three reasons, and they were Jordan, Copelan, and Cameron. They're my three children. I told them that they represent not only my three kids and their future, but they represented the kids and the grandkids of the district and the nieces and nephews of those that everybody in my district lived with and cared for, because it is their future that we're dealing with here. It's their future.
When we talk about the economics and when we talk about the problem we're in, this is the area in which we have got to work as a Congress. We cannot shirk the duty. We cannot pass it along. They expect us to act, and they expect us to act in a way in which, as we look forward, actually makes a difference in their lives.
President Obama recently told our Speaker that he doesn't believe we have a debt problem. We're $16 trillion in the hole, and our out-of-touch Commander in Chief doesn't think we have a serious problem on our hands. As my friend from North Carolina just stated--I want to go with the entire quote, and this is what was said:
The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. ``Leadership'' means the buck stops here. Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I, therefore, intend to oppose the effort to increase America's debt limit.
As we look at this issue, it really amazes me because I want to focus not on this debt issue but on basically what it says here. It says:
America has a debt problem, and it's a failure of leadership.
If it were a failure of leadership back in 2006, it must be a catastrophic nightmare at this point because all we've done is increase it. We've got to do better. We're borrowing almost half of every dollar we spend. If we don't provide serious measures to take care of it, we will leave our country in an absolute debacle for our kids and grandchildren, and that's simply not a price I'm willing to pay.
Our President just recently talked about not only a debt problem but that he doesn't believe we have a spending problem. I thought to myself that we don't have a spending problem; yet one of our colleagues, Representative Lankford, stated just the other day that in 2012 we'll have the third highest revenue year ever in the Federal Government, and yet we're still discussing the fact that we don't have a spending problem.
I'm sorry, Mr. President, this is not leadership. This is failure. We cannot continue to give the President and those on the other side of the aisle a blank check. Any discussion of raising the debt ceiling must also include an examination of serious reforms that need to be made to entitlement and discretionary spending.
On January 2, 2013, President Obama stated that we cannot continue to cut our way to prosperity.
Mr. President, on the contrary, we cannot tax and spend our way to prosperity either.
I think tonight we're starting what, I hope, will become a regular occurrence for this freshman class, my friend from Indiana. As we look at it, it's what I believe we have to do, and I believe it's about telling our story and about telling why conservative principles matter and how conservative principles, when we explain how we can get debt off their backs and spending under control, mean freedom for their kids to have a better future so that they can go to college and so that they can start that new business and employ other people. I believe America's greatest gift was found in the free enterprise system, and that's what we can encourage by getting our own fiscal house in order here tonight.
This is the time for us to come together, and I'm so pleased to stand with you and with the other freshmen here tonight. We're here to work, and we're here to make some hard choices and to realize this is all in America's best interests. I appreciate your letting me be a part of this tonight.",GA,COLLINS,0.909,R,thank friend indiana good good get start weve sent think that great thing us come togeth tonight share freshman perspect first day weve thrown congress realli dont believ experienc tough challeng think go interest time us appreci us get togeth tonight go forward mr speaker come great georgia ninth northeast georgia district full mountain valu common sens look district travel around almost 18 month kept hear peopl along want life look ahead someth brighter futur think right econom perspect look what go concern theyr look nation level theyr look debt theyr look econom budget issu theyr say effect go better kid grandkid thought travel around beganwhen ran told constitu run three reason jordan copelan cameron theyr three children told repres three kid futur repres kid grandkid district niec nephew everybodi district live care futur deal futur talk econom talk problem area got work congress cannot shirk duti cannot pass along expect us act expect us act way look forward actual make differ live presid obama recent told speaker doesnt believ debt problem 16 trillion hole outoftouch command chief doesnt think seriou problem hand friend north carolina statedi want go entir quot said fact today debat rais america debt limit sign leadership failur leadership mean buck stop instead washington shift burden bad choic today onto back children grandchildren america debt problem failur leadership american deserv better therefor intend oppos effort increas america debt limit look issu realli amaz want focu debt issu basic say say america debt problem failur leadership failur leadership back 2006 must catastroph nightmar point weve done increas weve got better borrow almost half everi dollar spend dont provid seriou measur take care leav countri absolut debacl kid grandchildren that simpli price im will pay presid recent talk debt problem doesnt believ spend problem thought dont spend problem yet one colleagu repres lankford state day 2012 well third highest revenu year ever feder govern yet still discuss fact dont spend problem im sorri mr presid leadership failur cannot continu give presid side aisl blank check discuss rais debt ceil must also includ examin seriou reform need made entitl discretionari spend januari 2 2013 presid obama state cannot continu cut way prosper mr presid contrari cannot tax spend way prosper either think tonight start hope becom regular occurr freshman class friend indiana look believ believ tell stori tell conserv principl matter conserv principl explain get debt back spend control mean freedom kid better futur go colleg start new busi employ peopl believ america greatest gift found free enterpris system that encourag get fiscal hous order tonight time us come togeth im pleas stand freshmen tonight work make hard choic realiz america best interest appreci let part tonight

Ladies and gentlemen, I rise in defense of the American people. I believe that we are at a tipping point in our history.

Will we reclaim the moral and fiscal discipline that made us, as Abraham Lincoln described us, the last best hope on Earth?
That is the essence of our challenge. That is the great and defining argument of our day.
In this debate, I'd like to remind all of us of a few critical facts. One of them is that this Nation, a Nation that is bankrupt, cannot provide for the security of its people. A Nation that is bankrupt cannot provide for the needy or for the poor among us. A Nation that is bankrupt cannot provide for the future of their children.
Yes, during these challenging times, it will require a commitment to fairness, and it will require a commitment to compassion. It always has. There has always been compassion in this Nation. That defines much of who we are--allowing the safety net to continue for those who truly need it. But where is the compassion in allowing a program, like my parents depended on in the final years of their lives, to continue down a pathway towards bankruptcy? Where is the compassion in creating so much uncertainty that our own children no longer have faith in their futures or in the social and safety net that has been there for previous generations? If you believe in compassion and fairness, then help us fix these problems. Help us to save them. Help us to provide so that we can pass them on to future generations.
Since the last election, this administration has talked about one thing and one thing only, and that is taxes. We have had that fight, and he has won. He got his tax increase, and that will raise between $60 billion and $70 billion, but the last deficit was $1.1 trillion.
Mr. President, what about the other trillion dollars now? What do we do now? We have a 6 percent solution. It's a great start if you like raising taxes, but it doesn't address the problems at all.
My father was an Air Force pilot. He was a pilot during World War II, and I had the great honor of serving for 14 years as an Air Force pilot as well. If there was one thing I learned from my father and those brave men and women with whom I served, it was courage, always to have courage. That is what we need now. That is the only thing that can save us.
Mr. President and Members of this body, let us have the courage to do the right thing even if that thing proves to be hard. Our debt is unsustainable. We talk about saving our Nation for our children. We don't have that long.

My name is Roger Williams. I have been a small business owner for 41 years. I represent Congressional District 25 in Texas, a great district. I have been meeting payrolls and creating jobs for 41 years and have been fighting government regulations for that period of time. I must tell you that, at a time when our national debt is over $16 trillion--more than $52,000 for each American--we must restore fiscal sanity in Washington. We do this by cutting spending, shrinking the deficit, and balancing the budget. As a businessman, when you're not selling your product, you don't raise taxes and you don't raise prices. You cut spending. That's where the money is. That's where the cash flow is, and that's what we've got to get to.
Our Nation's economic future is at stake. The Federal Government currently borrows more than 40 cents of every dollar it spends. I think we all agree it's time to get our fiscal house in order. Across this great Nation, the families have stretched their hard-earned dollars in order to make it through this struggling economy. The Federal Government must do the same and must do it now. We are facing a crisis because Washington just simply spends too much and wastes too much.
As I said, families all across this country are not looking to spend more money. They're looking to cut expenses and to meet the problems we all face today. The American people, I believe, do not support raising the debt. I ran on lower taxes, less government, to cut the spending. That's what my district wants. We don't need to raise the debt ceiling without cutting spending at the same time. That's what it's about. We need to create a net worth in America. I'm looking forward to the debate. We need to bring business principles back to Washington, D.C.

We have all been sent here to serve the people, and I look forward to representing the freedom-loving, hardworking people of Michigan.
More than two centuries ago, Members of the first Congress were summoned to uphold and defend the Constitution. Because of the Constitution, America became a shining symbol of freedom and prosperity to the world. Today, we must ensure that America retains that luster.
Everyone arrives here from different walks of life. Some are lawyers, some are business leaders, and yes, well, at least one of us is a reindeer rancher.
I recognize we all have different viewpoints, and I understand that I have joined Congress during a contentious time. I do think, however, there is one thing on which we should all agree: The job of a Member of Congress is to protect the rights of the people, not take them away.
The national debt is approaching $17 trillion. The decisions we make in this Chamber not only affect us today, they resonate throughout future generations. The massive national debt we are accruing will leave to our children a weaker Nation than the one we inherited from our parents. Those yet to be born do not have a voice today, they don't have representation, but we must remember what we do here resonates for generations to come.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for your time and help tonight as another distinguished Member of the freshman class. I hope we will have opportunities on other nights for you to be able to participate in these Special Orders.
As several have alluded to, our idea is just to be a part of the public debate. Everyone in this room tonight, everybody watching, has grown up in an America where you've known one very simple fact: that no matter what your current station in life, no matter where you came from, if you worked hard and stayed focused in this great country, you would have an opportunity to build a life for yourself; you would have an opportunity to live the American Dream.
And for the first time in my life, as I traveled through the Sixth District of Indiana and talked to people all across this country, people are doubting whether that will be true for the next generation, whether the next generation of young people and Americans will have the same kinds of opportunities that we all had growing up.
I think it is not an exaggeration to say that the upcoming debate in the next 2 months is really about the question of what are we willing to do to save our country, and this underlying question: Does Washington have enough? How much more must they take from the hardworking, taxpaying Americans who are trying to put their life together every day? I and my colleagues who spoke earlier today believe Washington has enough.

276,CA.GARAMENDI,CA,Garamendi,"I thank you, Mr. Speaker. It's good, it is very, very good that the new 113th Congress acted today to reach out in sympathy, compassion, and with real support to the people who were so severely impacted by Superstorm Sandy.
One of our colleagues, just a moment ago, spoke about this Nation being at a crossroad. And indeed, we cross paths many, many times and there are many different crossroads. The people of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and other parts of this great Nation here on the east coast came to a crossroads. That crossroads was 97 days ago when Superstorm Sandy came ashore and whacked and destroyed, pummeled and, indeed, killed Americans. 
Today, the House of Representatives, not unanimously, unfortunately, but by a strong majority of Democrats and some Republicans, stood tall and said we are one Nation. We're one Nation, and when one of us is harmed, we'll stand with that person. When one State is harmed, we'll stand with that State, and we will come together, just as my colleague said a moment ago, we will come together to provide what is needed to rebuild, to sustain, to provide, so that they who have been harmed can carry on.
There's a lesson here for all of us, and tonight my Democratic colleagues and I will talk about the lesson that Superstorm Sandy brought to this Nation. Certainly one of those lessons has been fulfilled today. As a great Nation, we will provide what is needed for the rebuilding, for the immediate needs, even though it is 97 days late. We will provide because we are a compassionate Nation.
But there's also another lesson here, and that lesson is for this entire Nation to get ahead of the next disaster. It will come. It'll be another storm up the east coast or into the gulf. It'll be an earthquake in my State of California or a flood or a fire. But there will be yet another natural disaster of one sort or another, perhaps man-made, perhaps Mother Nature.
What we must do as a Nation is to get ahead of that, to prepare ourselves not only with emergency responses, but more and just as important, to prepare the infrastructure to protect the lives and the property of the citizens of this Nation. That's the second lesson of Superstorm Sandy. Build the infrastructure to prepare for the next flood, the next hurricane, the next onslaught of Mother Nature. We can do it. And in so doing, we not only reduce the cost of that next storm, that next flood, but we also save the lives of Americans, and we put people to work right now.
This Nation is not yet fully recovered from the recession of 2008. This Nation has not yet fully brought Americans back to work, and we can do so taking the lesson of this day's action here on the floor of the House of Representatives where we, at least most of us, voted to build for the future, voted to put in place those infrastructure improvements, not for yesterday, not to rebuild just what was there that was destroyed, but, rather, to build for the future onslaught of a storm coming into New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, or other parts of this Nation.
To be prepared. The Boy Scout motto: Be prepared. Benjamin Franklin: An ounce of prevention is worth a dollar of cure. These are truisms that have been with us forever, and today we want to talk about infrastructure investment, the kind of things that were done here on the floor, some $33 billion going not only for immediate relief, but to build the infrastructure necessary to protect and prepare for the next storm.
Joining me today in this discussion, at least at the outset, is my colleague from New York, Paul Tonko. We often meet here on the floor. We sometimes call this the East Coast/West Coast show. I'm from California. Representative Tonko is from New York.
And you were there, not only for this storm, but for the previous storm, and that was less than 18 months ago.

277,NY.TONKO,NY,Tonko,"Sure. Thank you, Representative Garamendi. Thank you for bringing us together for this hour on the floor, where I think it's important to pay attention to the needs out there as they relate to the damages that were brought upon certain areas of the country by Mother Nature.
Yes, there's been a lot of focus with this on Superstorm Sandy. That really had its presence felt just to the south of my given congressional district. However, there was some damages in the northern reaches of upstate New York, the more northern sections as we traveled north of the metro area.
But suffice it to say, the need here for assistance by not only New York, but New Jersey and Connecticut, where the proper of New York, the metro area of New York City, Long Island, Westchester County, were impacted severely by this storm. As I said, on the fringe elements in my area, not as much. But certainly, New Jersey and Connecticut were hard hit.
But just over a year before that storm, you're absolutely right, we were impacted by Irene and Lee, a double dose of damage that really impacted my given congressional district severely. It looked like a war-torn area, as was the case here with Superstorm Sandy.
And this Nation, whenever impacted by natural or manmade disasters, found a response from Congress, that the President, whoever that person might be at the time, working with Congress, expedited the assistance, wanted to get that aid there with a high degree of urgency.
What we saw here was uncalled-for delays as people languished. I mean, we have to look at the human element here, the human cost of 88 Americans that were impacted, lives lost because of this tremendous devastation, the impact that befell so many communities with infrastructure being damaged severely, if not destroyed totally.
It was also about the impact on the business community, the loss to commerce, and certainly property damage that people are going to have to respond to over a long course of comeback that I have witnessed in my district with the storm, as you indicated, being more than a year ago.
And so it is important for us, as a Nation, to be responsive and responsible. That has always been the measure coming forth from this Nation, understanding, with sensitivity, what needed to be done and getting aid to people. That's what it's all about.
And so today, when finally a vote was taken, some 70 days after Superstorm Sandy hit, 70-plus days after the storm hit, finally we get a response, when so much pain and anguish was allowed to continue, unnecessarily so.
The infrastructure issues in this country, storms aside, need to be addressed. The American Society of Civil Engineers has graded many of our bridges into a D classification, a poor grade, deficiencies that are out there brought to our attention.
So not only do we need to respond to these tragedies and respond to our given infrastructure, but I think what happens here is an opportunity to come forward with job creation, providing for the trades and skilled tradespeople to be put to work. That is so important for our economy. It's so important for our public safety; it's so important for emergency response, as we've witnessed here in the northeast of the country.
And so while the fight was long and at times unnecessary, at least the vote was taken today and we moved forward.",NY,TONKO,-0.418,D,sure thank repres garamendi thank bring us togeth hour floor think import pay attent need relat damag brought upon certain area countri mother natur ye there lot focu superstorm sandi realli presenc felt south given congression district howev damag northern reach upstat new york northern section travel north metro area suffic say need assist new york new jersey connecticut proper new york metro area new york citi long island westchest counti impact sever storm said fring element area much certainli new jersey connecticut hard hit year storm your absolut right impact iren lee doubl dose damag realli impact given congression district sever look like wartorn area case superstorm sandi nation whenev impact natur manmad disast found respons congress presid whoever person might time work congress expedit assist want get aid high degre urgenc saw uncalledfor delay peopl languish mean look human element human cost 88 american impact live lost tremend devast impact befel mani commun infrastructur damag sever destroy total also impact busi commun loss commerc certainli properti damag peopl go respond long cours comeback wit district storm indic year ago import us nation respons respons alway measur come forth nation understand sensit need done get aid peopl that today final vote taken 70 day superstorm sandi hit 70plu day storm hit final get respons much pain anguish allow continu unnecessarili infrastructur issu countri storm asid need address american societi civil engin grade mani bridg d classif poor grade defici brought attent need respond tragedi respond given infrastructur think happen opportun come forward job creation provid trade skill tradespeopl put work import economi import public safeti import emerg respons weve wit northeast countri fight long time unnecessari least vote taken today move forward
278,CA.GARAMENDI,CA,Garamendi,"Thank you, Mr. Tonko. The bill now is out of this House. It's over in the Senate. We expect the Senate to pass it probably tomorrow or the next day, certainly before the inaugural on Monday, and then the President will undoubtedly sign it shortly thereafter, bringing that kind of relief.
You mentioned the job issue, and people need to go to work. When we have these natural disasters, and we come forward with the kind of support that we have seen today, and will soon be available for New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and the surrounding areas, people go back to work. Those people that have received immediate FEMA support for housing, for clothing, for food, that money's immediately spent into the economy.
On the infrastructure side, it's crucial. When the subways of Lower Manhattan flooded, the world's financial institutions took a whack because it was shut down for several days. People couldn't get to work, and so the entire world's economy slowed down, costing billions of dollars beyond just the damage.
Now, part of the infrastructure, part of the bill that was passed today, the infrastructure improvements are to harden, to prepare Manhattan and the surrounding areas, the beach communities and others, for the next storm, to put up the seawalls.
Now, what does that mean?
Well, it means that the ounce of prevention and the pound of cure have taken place, but it also means people are going to go to work.
Let me refer to this chart here. This is from Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, and the former economic adviser to John McCain. His analysis, and this is generally agreed to by most economists, is that for every dollar invested in infrastructure, you get $1.57 back into the American economy. So you're not just putting a dollar in. You're getting the American economy going. You're putting people to work.
Those people will then be able to pay taxes, buy food, support their families, and build for tomorrow's disaster, putting in place the infrastructure that is hardened, that is protected, eliminating the potential, in this specific case, of flooding of the subway systems in New York City.
I know that you talked about doing this in your area for the storm. You may want to pick that back up, and then I want to come back and talk about my own district in California.",CA,GARAMENDI,-0.322,D,thank mr tonko bill hous senat expect senat pass probabl tomorrow next day certainli inaugur monday presid undoubtedli sign shortli thereaft bring kind relief mention job issu peopl need go work natur disast come forward kind support seen today soon avail new jersey new york connecticut surround area peopl go back work peopl receiv immedi fema support hous cloth food money immedi spent economi infrastructur side crucial subway lower manhattan flood world financi institut took whack shut sever day peopl couldnt get work entir world economi slow cost billion dollar beyond damag part infrastructur part bill pass today infrastructur improv harden prepar manhattan surround area beach commun other next storm put seawal mean well mean ounc prevent pound cure taken place also mean peopl go go work let refer chart mark zandi chief economist moodi analyt former econom advis john mccain analysi gener agre economist everi dollar invest infrastructur get 1 57 back american economi your put dollar your get american economi go your put peopl work peopl abl pay tax buy food support famili build tomorrow disast put place infrastructur harden protect elimin potenti specif case flood subway system new york citi know talk area storm may want pick back want come back talk district california
279,NY.TONKO,NY,Tonko,"Right. You know, I think over and over again people are measuring with exit polling the sentiments of the electorate out there; and people have said that there is a need for government. They want effective government, efficient government.
Well, I think when we look at some of the data that are collected, Representative Garamendi, it is important for us to acknowledge that as we rebuild in our areas that have been damaged by Mother Nature, you don't just replace; you need to improve upon the situation.
For instance, if there are data that are telling us that more and more water volume is expected in certain watershed areas, as in my district, it would be foolish to spend tax dollars, the hard-earned taxpayer dollars and simply replace an infrastructure, a bridge, at the same height, at the same span, if, in fact, we know that the water and the force of that water is growing with time.
And so these are the ways to, I think, incorporate the soundness of academics and analysis that go into how we respond to this. And if much of it is driven by climate change, global warming, some of the impacts of Mother Nature that are causing these disruptive scenarios, then ought we not look at sound policy that then stretches our thinking and really puts a laser sharp focus on these situations?
So this is a call for a big-picture view. It's a call for effective replacement and repair so that we're responding to data that are collected that speak to the demographics that we should expect to have happen as we go forward and as we rebuild, making certain that there are those opportunities for waterfront communities to embrace their sense of geography.
I represent a district that is not only donor area to natural resources, but also historic resources in those waterways. And people want to have waterfront opportunities. They want to rebuild their communities so as to utilize these natural resources as a marketing agent to draw people to the area.
Well, we can steward those resources so as to tame the Mother Nature impact in a way that allows us to go forward with this re-marketing strategy, that allows us to utilize our sense of location, our place destination, and do it in a way that is possible because of preventative measures, because of retrofitting that can take hold; and it's a way to utilize the engineering services out there, civil engineering, architectural opportunities to build communities and build them in a way that allows us to have that sense of place only deepened, rather than denied because we've walked away from what might have been damage from Mother Nature and have abandoned those opportunities.",NY,TONKO,-0.418,D,right know think peopl measur exit poll sentiment elector peopl said need govern want effect govern effici govern well think look data collect repres garamendi import us acknowledg rebuild area damag mother natur dont replac need improv upon situat instanc data tell us water volum expect certain watersh area district would foolish spend tax dollar hardearn taxpay dollar simpli replac infrastructur bridg height span fact know water forc water grow time way think incorpor sound academ analysi go respond much driven climat chang global warm impact mother natur caus disrupt scenario ought look sound polici stretch think realli put laser sharp focu situat call bigpictur view call effect replac repair respond data collect speak demograph expect happen go forward rebuild make certain opportun waterfront commun embrac sens geographi repres district donor area natur resourc also histor resourc waterway peopl want waterfront opportun want rebuild commun util natur resourc market agent draw peopl area well steward resourc tame mother natur impact way allow us go forward remarket strategi allow us util sens locat place destin way possibl prevent measur retrofit take hold way util engin servic civil engin architectur opportun build commun build way allow us sens place deepen rather deni weve walk away might damag mother natur abandon opportun
280,CA.GARAMENDI,CA,Garamendi,"You're speaking of something that is very close I know to your heart. I've heard you speak on this issue some months ago about some of the historic buildings that date back to the pre-Revolutionary War era in New York.
And it's interesting to note that in this Sandy legislation that passed the House today there are numerous reforms, improvements on the way in which the Federal Emergency Management System works, so that the historic resources can be rebuilt and maintained, so that that sense of history, that sense of our past and who we are as Americans is going to be there for future generations. Some of the old rules and regulations made it virtually impossible to do that.
There's also in this legislation other reforms that allow the projects and homes and businesses to be rebuilt in a way that protects them from the future storms and the increased storms that you so aptly described.
Let me just take this home to my district. I represent the Central Valley of California, the great Sacramento Valley, 200 miles of it, literally from the beginning of San Francisco Bay 200 miles up the Sacramento River. And probably, I haven't been able to count all the levees in my district, but I probably have well over 1,500 miles of levees that protect large cities, medium size cities, farms and other critical assets and infrastructure in the State of California. For example, the intercontinental rail system both north and south, intercontinental highway systems, universities, international airports. These critical assets are at risk of flooding.
The Army Corps of Engineers is taking a look at the levees in one part of my district. The Natomas Basin, which is part of the city of Sacramento, judges those levees to have a 1 in 30 chance of failure, so that over a 30-year period of time it's anticipated there will be a catastrophic failure of those levees. One hundred thousand lives just in that part of Sacramento at immediate risk because those floodwaters--should those levees fail, it would be a repeat of what happened in New Orleans, only the water is deeper and the floodwaters would rush in, at least as fast, if not faster. A monumental disaster, international airport gone, highways gone and on and on.
We need to get ahead of that. We need to build that infrastructure, those levees, to protect those assets. A penny of prevention, a pound of savings.
So these are the kind of things that we can do. And there are ways we can do this. Yes, it may run up the immediate deficit. But once again, for every dollar that we invest in those levees we not only save lives and property, but we put people to work and we get the economic engine going.
Further up in my district, again along the Sacramento and the Feather Rivers, I have a project that's 44 miles of levee that clearly will fail. It has failed four times in the last 60 years. Lives have been lost. One of the most catastrophic failures of a levee happened in this stretch of river. We need to rebuild that.
The Federal Government's role in the construction projects of these levees has gone back to the very beginning of this Nation. And it is Congress' task to allocate the money, to decide the projects that are going to be built. But unfortunately, we've tied ourselves in knots here with certain rules that have been put in by our Republican colleagues that prevent us from taking the necessary action to protect our communities.

281,NY.TONKO,NY,Tonko,"Well, when you speak, Representative Garamendi, about the cost of these repairs or improvements we're talking about a design team, we're talking about a construction team, we're talking about a maintenance team. And all of that translates into jobs. So these efforts are, yes, an expenditure, but it's putting people to work and addressing not only public safety but commerce.
Again, my home county, which is split by a historic river, was the scene of a devastation just over 25 years ago where a New York State Thruway bridge collapsed because of the flooding that was occurring beneath that bridge. A creek that you could walk across, walk through in the middle of summer, was equal to in CFS, cubic feet per second, the flow of Niagara Falls. We lost 10 lives in that incidence, and also saw the impact locally to commerce. It just disrupted the flow of activity to ship goods to whatever section of our area. It totally disrupted that situation. That is just a microcosm of impact of what happens.
But you're very right. With the levees that might be at risk that could be a challenge to public safety, the poor ratings of our many, many bridges across this country, the need to begin aggressively to address these situations, means that you can bend that cost curve simply by moving projects forward, because the longer we go in time the more expensive it will be and the more risky it becomes with these deficient bridges.
So programs like The American Jobs Act or Build America Bonds, all of these efforts are a progressive bit of policy that then takes us to a new realm of thinking, a commitment to the safety of the people of this great country, a commitment to commerce and the doable qualities of having infrastructure vastly improved that enables us then to talk serious business about growing our Nation's economy.
So I think that the efforts here by the Democratic Caucus to bring to the attention of the full House the sort of positive thinking, the sort of planned opportunities that speak to the very nature of our infrastructure--and both of us represent States that rely heavily on well-developed and very well-maintained infrastructure--is indeed imperative. We need to move forward with a very strong supportive statement about this Nation's infrastructure.",NY,TONKO,-0.418,D,well speak repres garamendi cost repair improv talk design team talk construct team talk mainten team translat job effort ye expenditur put peopl work address public safeti commerc home counti split histor river scene devast 25 year ago new york state thruway bridg collaps flood occur beneath bridg creek could walk across walk middl summer equal cf cubic feet per second flow niagara fall lost 10 live incid also saw impact local commerc disrupt flow activ ship good whatev section area total disrupt situat microcosm impact happen your right leve might risk could challeng public safeti poor rate mani mani bridg across countri need begin aggress address situat mean bend cost curv simpli move project forward longer go time expens riski becom defici bridg program like american job act build america bond effort progress bit polici take us new realm think commit safeti peopl great countri commit commerc doabl qualiti infrastructur vastli improv enabl us talk seriou busi grow nation economi think effort democrat caucu bring attent full hous sort posit think sort plan opportun speak natur infrastructureand us repres state reli heavili welldevelop wellmaintain infrastructurei inde imper need move forward strong support statement nation infrastructur
282,CA.GARAMENDI,CA,Garamendi,"I would like to move in just a moment to the issue of how we can actually help other parts of our economy grow as we build our infrastructure. But before I do I am just thinking about the previous discussion from our Republican colleagues where they talked about the deficit and the deficit and we ought to eliminate government programs.
Certainly there are government programs that are neither efficient, effective, or necessary, and, yes, those should be cut. But when you start talking about infrastructure this is something that we really must do.
It was said that for an expenditure of some $15 billion New York City could have protected its subway system and the shoreline from the devastation of two major storms, one that occurred a year ago and another one that occurred just 97 days or 3 months ago, Superstorm Sandy.
So if we get ahead of these disasters and build the necessary protections, for example in my district if we build those levees, yes, it will cost money. For the Natomas area it's about $1 billion. Very expensive, no doubt about it.
But if we do not protect and do not build those levees the devastation will amount to several times that amount of money. That's precisely what happened in Manhattan and in the New York City area.
So again, you spend that money up front, yes, you put people to work, yes, there may be an immediate issue of where and how we fund it, and that's a legitimate issue, but fail to do it and then the cost is horrendous. And, yes, if the State, the Federal, the local governments, the individuals, that will all be an expense that they have to endure. And Superstorm Sandy, the bill we saw today, is precisely on that.
Now, having said that, let's talk about the broader subject. You mentioned Build American Bonds just a moment ago. The Build American Bonds were part of the stimulus program, now almost 4 years old.
That program created a new mechanism to assist local governments in providing the funding to build infrastructure--very, very successful in putting people back to work. We could extend that. In doing so, we will put people back to work. We will build the infrastructures, whether those are highways or bridges or whatever.
As we do that, one of our favorite topics that we've talked on this floor many, many times about is this: We can Make It in America. We use our taxpayer money to make and to spend that money on American-made products. So the steel in the bridges, the concrete, the other design elements are American jobs. And as we do that, we rebuild the American manufacturing base.

283,NY.TONKO,NY,Tonko,"Well, absolutely. The manufacturing element in our society is strong. It still is very much--a bit of statistical evidence that we rank high in the international economy with manufacturing jobs, but there was a huge loss in the decade before this administration; 4.6 million jobs lost in that manufacturing element. Well, in order for us to stop that bleeding, it's important, I believe, to promote advanced manufacturing. Retrofitting our manufacturing centers in a way that allows us to be cutting edge and doing it smarter--not necessarily cheaper, but doing it smarter--allows us to maintain that world leading status for manufacturing.
Also, as we talk about infrastructure, beyond the bonds effort and the American Jobs Act, an infrastructure bank bill that will allow us to utilize that concept to leverage public and private funds that expand the opportunities to invest in our infrastructure takes us well beyond the traditional roads and bridges and levees that we talked about, the waterfront opportunities and dam repair, but it also brings us into the infrastructure for telecommunications and for electric utilities so that we then are cutting edge. We can provide for an upgrade, if you will, in the grid system.
Now, we saw what that collapse was about in the year 2003, when branches rubbing on some power lines in Ohio put out the lights on Broadway in New York City. Now, that is unacceptable weakness. If there was ever a vulnerable, gaping situation that would have those looking at us for a weakness, it was there, that this grid system was so weak, designed for a monopoly setting and now being utilized to where electrons, not only region to region within States, but State to State if not nation to nation, with Canada wheeling in electrons into the 
So we need to vastly improve that sense of weakness in our system and allow us to speak to the needs of manufacturing because many are an energy-intensive operation. We need to be energy efficient so that they're utilizing their manufacturing process in a way that reduces cost, and to build into the equation all sorts of innovation so that they're doing things in a smarter fashion and able to compete at that international level for jobs; because as they land those contracts with improved operations, that means more American manufacturing jobs. That is that kind of approach, that cutting-edge thinking that enables us to maintain our sense of productivity, that embraces our intellectual capacity as a Nation, and that takes the research that we should invest into and allows us to translate that research opportunity into jobs.
So there are these dynamics of change and reform that can be brought into the discussions here as we go forward. That will speak, I think, to the vitality, the economic vitality of this Nation and the growth of jobs in a way that is significant, that is long lasting and that brings us into a sophisticated thinking, which this American society is very capable of doing.",NY,TONKO,-0.418,D,well absolut manufactur element societi strong still mucha bit statist evid rank high intern economi manufactur job huge loss decad administr 4 6 million job lost manufactur element well order us stop bleed import believ promot advanc manufactur retrofit manufactur center way allow us cut edg smarternot necessarili cheaper smarterallow us maintain world lead statu manufactur also talk infrastructur beyond bond effort american job act infrastructur bank bill allow us util concept leverag public privat fund expand opportun invest infrastructur take us well beyond tradit road bridg leve talk waterfront opportun dam repair also bring us infrastructur telecommun electr util cut edg provid upgrad grid system saw collaps year 2003 branch rub power line ohio put light broadway new york citi unaccept weak ever vulner gape situat would look us weak grid system weak design monopoli set util electron region region within state state state nation nation canada wheel electron need vastli improv sens weak system allow us speak need manufactur mani energyintens oper need energi effici theyr util manufactur process way reduc cost build equat sort innov theyr thing smarter fashion abl compet intern level job land contract improv oper mean american manufactur job kind approach cuttingedg think enabl us maintain sens product embrac intellectu capac nation take research invest allow us translat research opportun job dynam chang reform brought discuss go forward speak think vital econom vital nation growth job way signific long last bring us sophist think american societi capabl
284,CA.GARAMENDI,CA,Garamendi,"Last year, you and I talked--or last Congress, which was last year, you and I talked about this Make It in America, this manufacturing. We spent a lot of time talking about it. I had introduced in that session of Congress legislation that would require that our tax money--at least 85 percent of it--be spent on American-made products and equipment.
Let's take the Superstorm Sandy situation. We know that, for example, Amtrak is receiving, I think, a little over $150 million to repair its tracks that were damaged by Superstorm Sandy. Those are jobs--men and women will be working--but it's also steel, it's electrical wires, it's consultants, and it will undoubtedly be various kinds of electrical systems that will be used by Amtrak in rebuilding, similarly with regard to the subways in New York.
Now, if we were able to write into the Superstorm Sandy legislation that 85 percent of that money that's used on rebuilding the infrastructure came from American-made products--in other words, Buy America--then that would not only put people back to work, but it would stimulate the steel industry, the electrical industry, and certainly the consultants, engineers, and architects. So I'm going to reintroduce that legislation--too late now for Superstorm Sandy, but there will be other legislation.
For example, we know that we're going to have to rewrite a new transportation bill in this session. There's a 2-year bill that's now in place. It will expire at the end of the 213th Congress, so we're going to need to redo that. We should write into that transportation legislation--where we will spend $50 billion, $60 billion a year to build transportation systems--a clause like my bill that says that's taxpayer money; let's use that taxpayer money to buy American-made equipment and supplies, putting Americans back to work and using that to rebuild the American manufacturing sector along the lines that you describe, not with yesterday's technology, but with advanced manufacturing.",CA,GARAMENDI,-0.322,D,last year talkedor last congress last year talk make america manufactur spent lot time talk introduc session congress legisl would requir tax moneyat least 85 percent itb spent americanmad product equip let take superstorm sandi situat know exampl amtrak receiv think littl 150 million repair track damag superstorm sandi jobsmen women workingbut also steel electr wire consult undoubtedli variou kind electr system use amtrak rebuild similarli regard subway new york abl write superstorm sandi legisl 85 percent money that use rebuild infrastructur came americanmad productsin word buy americathen would put peopl back work would stimul steel industri electr industri certainli consult engin architect im go reintroduc legislationtoo late superstorm sandi legisl exampl know go rewrit new transport bill session there 2year bill that place expir end 213th congress go need redo write transport legislationwher spend 50 billion 60 billion year build transport systemsa claus like bill say that taxpay money let use taxpay money buy americanmad equip suppli put american back work use rebuild american manufactur sector along line describ yesterday technolog advanc manufactur
285,NY.TONKO,NY,Tonko,"Right. The efforts that we have with so much of manufacturing, with the incubator programs that enable us to provide for an innovation of sorts in any of these assembly operations is key, I think it's key to our future.
I think of those situations in my district, or even in my former district, where they worked with a local college that was very technically sophisticated. In this case, RPI, in the Greater Capital Region of New York, worked through its incubator program to develop these new opportunities within the plastics manufacturing that Kintz Plastics in Schoharie County utilized.
I think it's worth mentioning on this floor that that really brought about a new phase of activity for this company. By innovation, by readjusting its procedure, its process, they were able to compete more effectively. That required, however, that they move to training their workforce because it required a new skill set. As they did that, they reached out to a local community college, in this case, Hudson Valley Community College in the Capital Region of New York.
That partnership created the human infrastructure, the incubator provided the innovation, and they lived happily thereafter, because what they did was secure contracts in that international competitive sweepstakes because they provided for innovation. The improvements that they made to their assembly operation enabled them to maintain that sense of competitiveness.
It's that sort of thinking that takes us to a new level of job creation and job retention. Compounding that, or creating in the complement the Buy American concept, then inspires reaching to those local firms. It can all be done in that holistic sort of format, with a big picture sort of view that enables us to go forward and build upon sound policy, sound investment, with guarantees of much better outcomes for America's working families.

286,CA.GARAMENDI,CA,Garamendi,"You couldn't be more correct. You used the word ``holistic,'' meaning whole and in total, a total package. For years I've said that to have a growing economy and a just social environment, we needed to make, as Americans, critical investments. You hit three of those critical investments.
You talked about research--absolutely critical investment in the future growth of the economy and to solve today and tomorrow's problems. That's research, most of which, interestingly, is funded either directly by the Federal Government through the National Institutes of Health or Defense Research Agency, DARPA, or one of the other Federal agencies, or indirectly through the research tax credit that we provide for businesses to engage in research.
So research is one of the key investments that lead to economic growth. You mentioned the second one, very interesting, and that's education. A well educated workforce will be competitive across the world. That's a critical, perhaps the most critical, investment. Again, a role for the Federal Government, certainly a role for States and local governments, but a role for the American society that cannot be ignored--research, education.
You drew it very, very correctly, and that is the manufacturing that comes from that. Manufacturing matters. How do you do that? You need to be in front of it; and when you talked about the research and the manufacturing technology, you were spot on. That's the third critical investment. The fourth one we also talked about here is infrastructure. So these are four of the critical investments that we need to make as a society.
Some of that falls on individual companies, encouraged by a research tax credit or encouraged by Buy America. In different ways, we can encourage the manufacturing tax policy, which is critically important. We did that. Actually, it was a Democratic proposal. We did it 3 years ago. We've continued it. We've continued it in the recent fiscal cliff legislation where we provided 100 percent write-off for capital investment.
That was from the Democrats. We care about business, and so we said, grow your business. We will provide you with a 100 percent write-off in the first year of capital equipment that you put in place. Not depreciation over 3, 4, 7, 15 years, but rather immediate, an enormous benefit to business. So we want the businesses to invest so that they can Make It in America.
There are two more critical elements. I'll go through them very, very quickly. Provide for the national defense wisely. I think the public knows by now that we're spending $100 billion in Afghanistan this year--$100 billion. We need to bring it back home. We need to end that war. Thankfully, the President has set us off on a course where we will end American offensive action and move to supporting the Afghan Government in the spring of this year.
Mr. President, we're thankful that you put that policy. Now let's bring the rest of it home, $100 billion. We need that money here. So we need national defense, but we need to be really wise about how we spend our money.
Finally, the fifth thing is this: we need to change. We need to be willing to change. Thank you for bringing up the first three of those. But this is how we invest in the future, and these are policies that we need to put forward. They're the critical foundation for economic and social growth.",CA,GARAMENDI,-0.322,D,couldnt correct use word holist mean whole total total packag year ive said grow economi social environ need make american critic invest hit three critic invest talk researchabsolut critic invest futur growth economi solv today tomorrow problem that research interestingli fund either directli feder govern nation institut health defens research agenc darpa one feder agenc indirectli research tax credit provid busi engag research research one key invest lead econom growth mention second one interest that educ well educ workforc competit across world that critic perhap critic invest role feder govern certainli role state local govern role american societi cannot ignoredresearch educ drew correctli manufactur come manufactur matter need front talk research manufactur technolog spot that third critic invest fourth one also talk infrastructur four critic invest need make societi fall individu compani encourag research tax credit encourag buy america differ way encourag manufactur tax polici critic import actual democrat propos 3 year ago weve continu weve continu recent fiscal cliff legisl provid 100 percent writeoff capit invest democrat care busi said grow busi provid 100 percent writeoff first year capit equip put place depreci 3 4 7 15 year rather immedi enorm benefit busi want busi invest make america two critic element ill go quickli provid nation defens wise think public know spend 100 billion afghanistan year100 billion need bring back home need end war thank presid set us cours end american offens action move support afghan govern spring year mr presid thank put polici let bring rest home 100 billion need money need nation defens need realli wise spend money final fifth thing need chang need will chang thank bring first three invest futur polici need put forward theyr critic foundat econom social growth

This had to be 6 or 7 years ago, I was Lieutenant Governor of California, and 3M, the manufacturing company, came in to talk about exactly that issue; and they had researched and developed a new conductor that was 30 percent more efficient in passing those electrons down the line. Think about what we could do in America to improve our energy capability by putting that in place; and if that were made in America, we could not only improve the energy efficiency. We would increase the capacity of our electrical system by 30 percent simply by rewiring those conductors across this Nation. That's American manufacturing, research and manufacturing.

289,NY.TONKO,NY,Tonko,"There are so many of us that are fans of education, higher education investment. Think about it, we cultivate all of this talent, we draw forth the abilities of people through education, and we allow them to discover who they are. What are the gifts that I bear that can be utilized to strengthen society? Well, we make that investment and then don't gain on it. We don't stretch those opportunities to the max.
It's so important, I believe, to continually think beyond the status quo. And when we're dealing with the energy arena, it's a line-loss for one that allows for huge savings, and great opportunities for jobs to research that potential; but it's also issues like waste heat which can be recaptured and make our energy system more efficient. So as we create and generate these energy supplies, if there's waste there, and we can captivate, or capture, that waste and stretch the amount of energy supply that we can create, here yet is another opportunity.
So it's endless. And for us to just continue to do the same old kind of responses to everyday issues isn't the sort of challenging outcome that I think allows us to best function as an American society.
So there are policies and there are tax reforms that encourage and inspire this sort of investment, research tax credits, opportunities within the renewable energy area with production tax credits. All of this, being promoted in advance, we need to expand upon those opportunities.

290,CA.GARAMENDI,CA,Garamendi,"Well, we have a little bit more time. I think it's about time for us to wrap all of this into one piece. And I will take the first shot at it, and then if you would be so kind as to finish it up.
I'm thinking of Chicago. It's not my territory. It's a long way from California. It's a beautiful city, a very dynamic city. At the turn of the previous century, in the late 1800s, they had an architect, a city architect, Burnham, and he wrote: Think no small thought for it stirs not the heart of man. Very interesting. We ought to add women to that equation now. But what he said is that when we rebuild this city, we need to build big. We need to think bold thoughts. We need to think about the greatness that could exist if we step forward.
Earlier in the previous hour we heard about the exact opposite. We heard about inward, thinking small, we are not going to reach out and fulfill the great potential of this Nation. Instead, we're going to retreat. We're not going to allow government to be part of the greatness of our future; but, instead, we're going to make it smaller and less viable. And those five things that I talked about, education, that's a public investment. Infrastructure is both public and private. But the public side is critical.
You look at manufacturing, manufacturing has always been private; but it has also relied upon the public sector. And if we use our tax dollars to buy American-made products, we are causing the manufacturing sector to grow, to blossom and to innovate and to be even greater than it is today. In developing the research, that's both public and private, but it is largely a public sector investment. So we can deal with this by investing, by thinking boldly about what it is we can do and, in doing so, make certain that everything we invest in publicly is necessary, that it is run efficiently, and that its outcome is effective, and that it fulfills the goal for which it was designed.
Those should be our watchwords: efficient, effective, necessary, and bold. Think no small thought. This is America. This is the world's greatest country perhaps ever, and it was created by bold thinking, both public and private working together in a synergy that created this incredible Nation.
I'm excited. I'm excited here in the very early days of the 113th Congress. I know we're going to have some big battles over debt limits and the like. But as we go through those fights, I want us to be bold. I want us to be big in our thinking. I want us to fulfill the great potential of this Nation. And I know we can do it.

291,NY.TONKO,NY,Tonko,"Representative Garamendi, what I hear you say is probably a definition of the American Dream.
The American Dream was designed and brought to us by the boldness of generation upon generation of immigrants who added to the peoplescape of this great Nation, added to the native American population by stages of journeys that traveled to these shores. We as a compilation of those journeys are a stronger people. The foundation upon which we stand and function and dream was developed by people who dared to dream nobly, dared to invest in their community, in their people. That, I think, is the challenge to us in this very moment in time.
Will history see us as a people that dreamt beyond the ordinary, or will we be those who were frightened by the thoughts of the challenges of our times? I think that our greatest days lie ahead of us. The American Dream that burns boldly and nobly in our hearts speaks to us as that beacon of inspiration.

293,TX.GOHMERT,TX,Gohmert,"Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to get to know you better all the time and to be serving with you.
I enjoyed hearing my friends talking about the economy and things that are going on. So I wanted to address a few things. I didn't come over here and plan to address what they had, but they were mentioning their hope for us, bringing our troops home from Afghanistan. And having been there a few times, having talked to the former allies that this administration has thrown under the bus that initially defeated the Taliban for us with less than 500, possibly less than 300 embedded Special Forces, special ops, and intelligence personnel embedded with the Northern Alliance, they defeated the Taliban in about 3 or 4 months.
Then we added troops and became occupiers. Occupiers in that part of the world don't do well. Someone reminded me of what I already knew, that Alexander the Great conquered that area around Afghanistan, and I had to remind them that he died on his way out of the area. I don't consider that a great victory.
Nonetheless, we helped give the Afghans a government and sharia law, making it difficult for Jews and Christians to reside in a country where they once had. Under this administration's watch, like I say, we've thrown our allies under the bus, and the Taliban has come back almost strong as ever, not quite. Some of my Northern Alliance friends told me in one of our visits over there that on national television last year, the Taliban leader that this administration released for humanitarian purposes from Gitmo didn't seem to be having health problems and was on national television and was making clear that the U.S. would be withdrawing in the next year or two, and that when they did the Taliban would be back in charge as they were before. So it was time to come beg forgiveness from the Taliban and ask for their protection under sharia law.
That doesn't sound like we're going to be in a whole lot better position after all the losses of life, all of the servicemembers who have laid down their lives in Afghanistan, who continue to do that as we speak because the Commander in Chief has them there without any real mission laying down their lives. As one of our troops told me, ``I don't mind laying down my life for my country, but please don't waste it.''
They're not laying down their lives for a wishy-washy government that can't figure out what it wants to do, that leaves our military without a clear mission, that allows the Taliban to come back stronger than ever, supplied and funded in part from Pakistan. They deserve better. They deserve much better.
Our Commander in Chief was on television yesterday talking about the debt limit, the debt ceiling. He's talked about our economy. I think it's worth noting that since 1923, the President was required to furnish a budget and a time deadline given for furnishing that budget. Ninety years. Ninety years, the President is required by law to furnish a budget.
Since 1923, those ensuing 90 years, there have apparently been 11 times when presidents have been unable to get the budget to Congress as required by law. For some of those 11, there were very good reasons. But it's interesting to note in the last 90 years, out of the 11 times that the budget from the President has been late, 4 of those 11 have been under the Obama administration.
We're also informed that there is a chance once again, as there was a year and a half ago, that our credit rating of the U.S. could be lowered again by another credit rating agency. Some have tried to paint it as a different story, a different picture. But for those of us who recall what happened, S&P made it clear that they didn't believe that the United States was serious about dealing with this dramatic overspending problem, where we were spending $1.5 trillion, $1.6 trillion, over a trillion dollars more than the 2-plus trillion dollars that we had coming in. And that if we didn't at least reduce the massive overspending annually by at least $400 billion for 10 years, a total of $4 trillion over a 10-year period, then it would make it pretty clear that we were not serious about dealing with our debt.
I know the Obama administration went on the warpath after the S&P credit rating was lowered. Personally, I think it's to S&P's credit that they did what they said. We came in with a debt ceiling bill that was agreed to with the administration. It had some sequestration in it with the supercommittee that some of us knew wasn't going to work because the Democrats had made it clear they didn't want a supercommittee to work because they wanted to be able to campaign and say, Gee, cuts are coming to Medicare because the Republicans were trying to protect their rich friends. It worked very well. They wouldn't reach an agreement. Even after somebody like a Republican Senator had a proposal to raise new revenue, a couple of Democrats were reported as saying that this was going to be the breakthrough that allowed an agreement. After consulting with the President, to Harry Reid it apparently was made clear we don't want to deal. No, no deal, so there was no deal, and now the sequestrations are about to take place.

294,TX.GOHMERT,TX,Gohmert,"So we had a debt ceiling bill that was undermined from the beginning. No deal was reached. Sequestration--massive cuts to our national security, to our national defense--would be inflicted and massive cuts to Medicare. Our leaders responded to me that, Gee, the Democrats will never allow the cuts to Medicare, the sequestration to Medicare, $300 billion or so. They'll never allow that. That's why we know the supercommittee will reach an agreement. I advised them that that would not happen, that there would be no agreement, that of course they're willing to have a $300 billion or so cut to Medicare, because ObamaCare cut $700 billion from Medicare from our seniors' care without a single Republican vote.
So the only way that Democrats would run a commercial last year, in 2012, with any sincerity at all was in saying, Gee, Republicans are cutting Medicare. If they were to prevent Republicans from reaching an agreement with the President and Democrats, then they could run commercials in 2012, and they'd blame the Republicans and say, See, they didn't reach an agreement. They wanted to cut seniors and help their rich friends.
As some of us made clear, we weren't nearly as concerned at all about protecting anybody as we were future generations. How embarrassing that our generation is the first generation in American history that has said by our actions that we are not concerned with leaving our children and our grandchildren--future generations--a better country than we found. We're more concerned with lavishing money on the here and now that we can't pay for and that future generations will pay for because we can't stop spending on ourselves.
We had a vote today on relief for Hurricane Sandy, and we know something about the pain that comes from hurricanes. In my district in east Texas, not only did we face consequences from Hurricane Katrina and the hundreds of thousands of people who came through--and many stayed in east Texas--and from the onslaught of weather that hit east Texas, but it was immediately followed by Hurricane Rita, which swept straight up through east Texas, through my district. We know about suffering. We saw how Louisiana was helped so much more than east Texas even though, at the very time we were hit with Hurricane Rita, we were taking care of victims from Hurricane Katrina. We understand about that, but there is a lot of misinformation about Hurricane Katrina.
For Hurricane Katrina, we did offset spending when Republicans were in the majority. We actually then turned money back that was not spent. Our hearts go out to the victims of Hurricane Sandy, especially those who understand what that kind of suffering is.
I was all over my district. A Democratic sheriff told his county once that he'll never forget midnight after Hurricane Rita hit--no power. There in the county, there was no power at the sheriff's office. There was a generator that had kicked on, and the lights were flickering. After midnight, his U.S. Congressman came walking through his door and said, What can I do to help? To get there to San Augustine, I had to cut down trees that were across the road and over to Hemphill.
It's tough when dealing with the consequences of a hurricane. People are hurt. Buildings, homes are destroyed. We understand that. We wanted to help the victims of Hurricane Sandy, but what we didn't want to do and what we'd hoped there would be plenty of responsibility in dealing with was pork that was placed in this bill for emergency purposes. It just seems a bit immoral that you would take advantage of the suffering of people during a hurricane to get one last big plug of money. I mean, it's all so pretty discouraging to see that there is money being captured, taking advantage of the victims of a hurricane to enrich and engorge themselves. There ought to be a law against it, but there isn't because this Chamber, led by the Senate down the hall, is still putting pork in these bills to go to things that have nothing to do with the hurricane, and they're not offset. We have no problem on both sides of the aisle in helping victims who can't help themselves, but we ought to pay for it now.
When a former Member of Congress and one of the greatest heroes Texas history has, named Davy Crockett--he was a U.S. Congressman from Tennessee--stood before the House of Representatives, right down the hall here in the old House Chamber, he explained what he was lectured to by a constituent: Don't take my money. Take your own money to help charitable causes.
Not only do we not do that, but we take other people's money to help, and they get all this pork added in order to get enough votes to pass it. Then it ought to be the biggest regret of this generation that we don't even pay for it. How in the world could this body fail to pass a bill that would pay for helping the victims of Hurricane Sandy? But we don't have the money to do it, so we're going to borrow between 40 and 50 cents of every dollar of money both for the pork and for the help for Hurricane Sandy because this body got sweet talked into refusing to pay for helping this generation. We'll let our children and our children's children and maybe their children pay for this. We will load them up with debt because we will not pay our own way. We're too narcissistic. We're too self-indulgent. We are not going to pay our way, and that kind of attitude is a tragedy. It brings countries down.
What brings a country to the peak of their greatness is when generation after generation does not fail to honor the God that has blessed that country and they have a commitment that we were taught in Boy Scouts that you leave a place better than you found it, and you leave better for those coming behind you. And it's embarrassing that this White House and the Senate and this House are comfortable enough to leave a country massively more in debt than when this generation came to leadership. It's heartbreaking.
And one of the reasons we are not effectively dealing with this problem is because not enough people know the truth. They don't know the history of this country. Apparently, the President thinks it's perfectly okay to just forget about the rule of law. Oh, there's a law that says I have to provide a budget. Well, I'm not doing it. I'll get around to it. But the law says he must. Is he above the law? Apparently so. Because of the 11 times in the last 90 years when the budget was late, four of them were this President.
You know, when you talk to economists and you read what economists are saying, and you're concerned about the downgrade in the credit rating because of how much more money that will put us in debt that future generations will have to pay, when you talk to them, you look at what they're saying, there are a couple of things that they point out.
Well, one of the things that helped this country is our belief and support for the rule of law, that no one is above the law. And yet you look at what this White House is doing: ah, we'll get around to the budget eventually. More insensitive to following the law than any Presidency that I can find in history.
We have a President who says, you know, yeah, I get it, the Defense of Marriage Act was duly passed into law and signed into law by a former Democratic President, but I don't like that law and I realize Congress is not going to change it, so I'm going to ignore the law. I'm going to instruct my Attorney General to ignore the law. That kind of thinking means there's no support at the highest level of this country for the rule of law.
When we have a President who makes speeches and an Attorney General who makes speeches about how they're going to go after illegal gun sales, and yet there is blood on the hands of people in this administration, and we can't even find out who they are because they are being obscured, for the death of hundreds of human beings who died because this administration forced gun dealers to sell guns that they knew and they reported should not be sold, and they were told by their Federal Government, their executive branch, you do it anyway because we're going to follow the guns, in effect. The guns were not followed. They made their way into criminals' hands, as was intended, but they weren't followed. And now the administration says they want to support the rule of law and go after these illegal gun sales? Well, they have to start with their own administration.
And then we have a President that instead of coming to Capitol Hill where most of the elected representatives of the country are, there's one down Pennsylvania Avenue, actually two, the Vice President, and there are 535 down here, and sitting down and working out a comprehensive immigration bill, instead of doing that, the President announces, you know, I don't like the laws that were duly passed by prior Congresses, Democrats, signed into law by Democrats and Republican Presidents. I realize what the law is, I don't like the law, so as I speak, so shall the new law be.
And the mainstream just laps it up because they're too ignorant of what the rule of law means, that you don't have a monarch at the end of Pennsylvania Avenue that just espouses law as he gets ready to, because he doesn't like the law that was duly passed.
Come down here and work with us and if we can secure the border so that we can make sure that people won't get in that want to destroy our way of life, the drug cartels, the radical Islamists across the border that are working with the drug cartels now that want to destroy our way of life, we've got to make sure that we have people coming in that will continue to make the country great. And I have great hope for what the Hispanic community can do for this country because, generally speaking, those I know have strong faith in God, devotion to family, and hard work ethic. That's what made America great, in my opinion. We need that kind of input, but it's got to be legal.
The Immigration Service is an embarrassment, one of the worst in the world. You can get a visa quicker to other countries than you can here. It's embarrassing the snafus in this government.
But if we are going to get on track, we have to get back to a President and a Congress that believes the rule of law. And when the President will not follow the law, there have to be consequences.
I've talked to Democratic and Republican individuals who were part of prior Presidential administrations and I've said at different times, different individuals: tell me, when you were in the administration, when you were in the White House, is it true what I've heard that individuals would come together, both parties, both ends of the Capitol and talk to the President and say, look, you are usurping control that was given to the Congress in the Constitution, and we're going to have to shut you down if you don't get back and acting within the Constitution?
That doesn't happen under this administration, and it's time that it must. We owe it to the country. We owe it to future generations.
The President has said: If Congress in any way suggests they're going to tie negotiation to debt ceiling votes--which, by the way, we have never done in our history until we did it last year--I will not play that game.
The President needs to have someone around him that knows the truth. That poor man is being lied to. All you have to do is look back in our history. Every time there was a cut in spending, it was often tied to the debt ceiling negotiations. Go back to 1985, to 1990, 1993, 1997, 2010. Speaker Pelosi in 2010, with President Obama, tied a PAYGO provision. She did it. Why is it so wrong that the Republicans want to do that in the House like Speaker Pelosi did. Let's get responsible. But the President doesn't even remember 2 years ago when Speaker Pelosi did that.
Somebody has got to help this poor man understand recent and distant history before the rating agencies say, you know what, we used to think that the rule of law was going to help the U.S. economy and help the Federal Government get around to taking care of its debts, but these guys don't even follow the rule of law anymore.
And as far as what economists say, yeah, but we have economic dynamism. Well, look what ObamaCare is doing to that. Look at what overregulation is doing to that. It is hurting our economy. The economy is sitting waiting to take off if the President and the Senate, that is bogging down bills that would free up the economy to go, if they would get out of the way, this economy could go. People could get back to work. They wouldn't need unemployment. They wouldn't need to be begging to the master government. They could do it on their own as free people.
It's time to get back to following the rule of law. It's time to get back to having a government that doesn't put off the current debt on future generations because if we don't, our names will not be called blessed by future generations. Our names will be cursed.
Mr. Speaker, it is my prayer and desire that we can finally get to be responsible in the coming months. And the only way we can really get there is if people are honest about our history.

Even as our country faced significant challenges, partisan posturing and political brinksmanship dominated the debate in Washington and created an unprecedented level of gridlock that kept real work from getting done.
As we begin the work of the 113th Congress, it is critical that both Democrats and Republicans commit to working with their colleagues across the aisle and putting the long-term interests of our country ahead of their own short-term political goals.
That's why I have decided to join a group of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans in an organization called No Labels as a problem-solver which will meet regularly to build trust and cooperation between members of both parties and get Washington back to a place where Democrats and Republicans working together is the rule rather than the exception.
We need leaders in Congress who are serious about finding solutions to the challenges we face both at home and abroad.
I am convinced that there is no challenge so great that we cannot solve by working together, and No Labels is offering a venue for Republicans, Democrats, and Independents to do exactly that.

302,IN.MESSER,IN,Messer,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the first time in this Chamber to urge the President and Congress to get serious about addressing the out-of-control borrowing and spending that is jeopardizing the American Dream for our children and grandchildren.
The President has said that the debt ceiling debate is not the time to tackle Washington's spending addiction and has called for more taxes, more spending and more borrowing in return for any future spending reforms. Yesterday he said, ``We can't finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone.'' But the last Congress already raised taxes. Now it's time to tackle Washington's binge spending.
The fundamental question to be answered in the upcoming debate is whether Washington should take more than it already confiscates from hardworking, taxpaying Americans. The answer is no. Washington doesn't tax too little. It spends too much.
Mr. Speaker, the new freshman Republican Members of the House are holding a Special Order after today's legislative business to highlight the urgency of the upcoming debt ceiling debate. I hope as many of my colleagues who can will join this effort and explain to the American people why we owe it to our children to stop spending and borrowing and start controlling our debt.",IN,MESSER,0.796,R,mr speaker rise today first time chamber urg presid congress get seriou address outofcontrol borrow spend jeopard american dream children grandchildren presid said debt ceil debat time tackl washington spend addict call tax spend borrow return futur spend reform yesterday said cant finish job deficit reduct spend cut alon last congress alreadi rais tax time tackl washington bing spend fundament question answer upcom debat whether washington take alreadi confisc hardwork taxpay american answer washington doesnt tax littl spend much mr speaker new freshman republican member hous hold special order today legisl busi highlight urgenc upcom debt ceil debat hope mani colleagu join effort explain american peopl owe children stop spend borrow start control debt

Americans have been very clear about what the priorities of Congress should be. At the forefront of these priorities is to get people back to work and to revitalize our economy.
There is no doubt there has been some progress. Thirty-four consecutive months of private sector job growth is evidence of that. However, with 12 million people still unemployed, more must be done.
If Congress is serious about addressing the deficit, then we must have a plan--such as the Make It in America agenda--to create jobs. Job creation leads to deficit reduction and is necessary for a full economic recovery.
I am confident that with a new year will come a renewed focus to do the work of the American people.

Today I would like to recognize an exceptional Minnesota organization that has become known as a national model for excellence in mentoring and service. The mentoring partnership works with hundreds of Minnesota organizations to pair up mentors with mentees and help strengthen relationships and build stronger communities.
Every child deserves a mentor. As Fortune magazine recently pointed out, the number one indicator of success for a child is a good relationship with a caring adult. They provide care and support, advice, and words of encouragement. Dr. King often spoke of his mentors, and likewise became one himself to many Americans.

307,TN.COHEN,TN,Cohen,"Mr. Speaker, the House just finished the reading of the Constitution. And that's fine. It's a majestic document, greatest of its kind, and it's never bad to read it.
It's one thing to read it and it's another thing to really understand it. And to understand it you've got to understand the court decisions and how the courts have interpreted the Constitution.
The courts have recognized the Constitution as a living evolving document and that it's not perfect. Congress had to pass an amendment to formally abolish slavery. It took the Supreme Court in the Topeka Board of Education v. Brown case to abolish Jim Crow, the stepchild of slavery and a great stain on this country's history.
Thanks to Roe v. Wade women have a fundamental right to make medical decisions about their own bodies, a right that continues to be threatened by this Congress. And while the Constitution grants great freedoms, the courts recognize that they come with reasonable limitations.
The First Amendment gives us freedom of speech but doesn't allow us to yell fire in a theater or to libel somebody.
And the Second Amendment, while it gives you the right to bear arms, has limitations as well. You can't carry a gun on an airplane or in a courtroom, and we need to remember that.
So just reading the Constitution is one thing, but understanding is another.

The Northwest National Marine Energy Center, based at Oregon State University, will be constructing the Pacific Marine Energy Center to test energy generation potential and environmental impacts of these wave energy devices.
NNMREC, established in 2008, is a partnership between Oregon State University and the University of Washington and is one of only three U.S. Department of Energy-supported marine renewable energy centers. In addition to the Department of Energy, this work is supported by my State of Oregon, the Wave Energy Trust, and other private and public agencies.
NNMREC's selection of Newport as the site will not only benefit the community of Newport but, frankly, the entire Oregon coast and will set a course for Oregon and the Nation to be one step closer to energy independence.
I am also very proud of Oregon State University and their continued leadership in this area. I would be very remiss if I didn't give a shout out to the incredible work done by Belinda Batten, director of NNMREC, and Annette von Jouanne, professor at Oregon State University, and all the faculty and students in the Wave Energy Department at OSU.

Really, without this package passing today and then immediately going to the Senate to be passed there as well and signed by the President, the whole effort to try to rebuild the shore in time for the summer season--the jobs, the tourism, the economy related to that--would really be seriously jeopardized.
I would urge that my colleagues adopt not only the initial base bill, the Rogers' amendment, but also the Frelinghuysen amendment. The Frelinghuysen amendment, which is the additional $33 billion, will let us basically do a lot of the shore protection, the beach replenishment, the dunes, the flood controls, to prevent damage from a future storm, and also provide the Community Development Block Grants, the grants that there's a lot of flexibility for the towns so they can go back and basically give grants to homeowners as well as small business.

Whether sharing MREs in Germany with Private Elvis Presley or serving at the Pentagon on the staff for the Joint Chiefs alongside General Colin Powell, General Gourley worked tirelessly to improve the lives of men and women in the United States military. Even in his retirement, the general's vision was to build a health care center on the site of the former Fort Ord that would serve both the needs of Active Duty and retired military personnel.

That is part of the submission by the Coast Guard for relief in the Hurricane Sandy bill, which we are going to debate and vote on, unfortunately.

Education was not Alba's only pursuit, and she embarked on a distinguished military career at the onset of World War II. In 1942, Alba was commissioned Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force. By the time she separated from active duty, she had achieved the rank of Major and had been awarded seven ribbons for her dedicated service.

317,CT.HIMES,CT,Himes,"Mr. Speaker, it is with heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend and outstanding community leader, John Hammerslough.
His passing marks the end of an era in Weston, Connecticut and the loss of a dear friend to many across Connecticut.
John was a fixture in Weston's civic community for half a century, died on January 2 after a brief illness. He was 84 years old and had lived in Weston with his wife Nancy since 1959.
John understood the importance of serving the public and at one point or another he was a member of Weston's Board of Selectmen, the Board of Finance, the Police Commission, among other roles, and was active in local, state and national political campaigns. Along with his wife, he was named ``Democrat of the Year'' in 2009 by the Democratic Town Committee, and the town of Weston proclaimed May 11, 2009, as ``John and Nancy Hammerslough Day.''
John Hammerslough was a pioneer in the emerging field of computer-driven analysis of financial securities. His role as director of computer research at Shields & Co. was unusual enough at the time that The New York Times profiled him and ``his electronic computer'' in June 1967. The computer, the article noted, ``is no bigger than an office desk.''
John Hammerslough was born in New York City in 1928, the son of Charles R. Hammerslough, a clothier and sometime theatrical producer, and the former Sylvia Rittenberg. He attended the Bronx School of Science and the Taft School, and graduated from Brown University.
After college, he entered the army and served in the Korean War, first as an infantryman and later as a public information officer. The experience spurred him in later years to speak out against American involvement in Vietnam and, more recently, against the invasion of Iraq.
Although Mr. Hammerslough was involved in the financial securities business for nearly half a century, he did not immediately go to work on Wall Street as a young man. Rather, his experience as a writer and audio producer for the army during the Korean War led him to join CBS as part of its fledgling television news operation.
After a stint in the news business, he returned to school to do post-graduate work in mathematics at New York University, which led him to Wall Street, where his specialty was the use of computer analysis for valuing securities. His group at Shields & Co. operated the first computer at a Wall Street firm dedicated solely to investment research. He continued to focus on computer-assisted financial research through the 1970s.
Of his work, Mr. Hammerslough told the New York Times in 1967: ``The computer is suggestive rather than dictatorial. It's loaded with technique, but it has no judgment. The machine, therefore, represents an extension of our intelligence.''
Since the early 1980s, Mr. Hammerslough worked as a financial expert in litigation support, providing advice and testimony in more than 1,000 matters involving securities and alleged violations of securities law.
A devoted Westonite, he was a familiar figure not only at Town Hall but also at the town center, where he could be seen most mornings drinking coffee with friends and talking politics and sports, at holiday parades and celebrations, where he sold ice cream and handed out buttons for the Democratic Party, and along the roads near his home, where he enjoyed walking his beloved dog.
I join all of his friends and colleagues in extending my deepest sympathies to John's wife Nancy, his son, Charles, daughter, Jane, and four grandchildren Phin, Alex, Zach and Shira.",CT,HIMES,-0.244,D,mr speaker heavi heart rise today pay tribut good friend outstand commun leader john hammerslough pass mark end era weston connecticut loss dear friend mani across connecticut john fixtur weston civic commun half centuri die januari 2 brief ill 84 year old live weston wife nanci sinc 1959 john understood import serv public one point anoth member weston board selectmen board financ polic commiss among role activ local state nation polit campaign along wife name democrat year 2009 democrat town committe town weston proclaim may 11 2009 john nanci hammerslough day john hammerslough pioneer emerg field computerdriven analysi financi secur role director comput research shield co unusu enough time new york time profil electron comput june 1967 comput articl note bigger offic desk john hammerslough born new york citi 1928 son charl r hammerslough clothier sometim theatric produc former sylvia rittenberg attend bronx school scienc taft school graduat brown univers colleg enter armi serv korean war first infantryman later public inform offic experi spur later year speak american involv vietnam recent invas iraq although mr hammerslough involv financi secur busi nearli half centuri immedi go work wall street young man rather experi writer audio produc armi korean war led join cb part fledgl televis news oper stint news busi return school postgradu work mathemat new york univers led wall street specialti use comput analysi valu secur group shield co oper first comput wall street firm dedic sole invest research continu focu computerassist financi research 1970 work mr hammerslough told new york time 1967 comput suggest rather dictatori load techniqu judgment machin therefor repres extens intellig sinc earli 1980 mr hammerslough work financi expert litig support provid advic testimoni 1 000 matter involv secur alleg violat secur law devot westonit familiar figur town hall also town center could seen morn drink coffe friend talk polit sport holiday parad celebr sold ice cream hand button democrat parti along road near home enjoy walk belov dog join friend colleagu extend deepest sympathi john wife nanci son charl daughter jane four grandchildren phin alex zach shira

This program attracts visitors from around the world, and it has been extremely beneficial to the local Massachusetts tourism industry. Its popularity was recently highlighted in The Boston Globe as a unique activity that all can enjoy.
Mr. Speaker, as the cofounder of the Congressional Cranberry Caucus, it brings me great pride to recognize Jeffrey LeFleur upon his retirement from the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association.

320,OH.RYAN,OH,Ryan,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of an exemplary public servant, Judge John M. Stuard. After nearly five decades of service, Judge Stuard has retired with distinction from the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas in Warren, Ohio.
Judge Stuard earned his undergraduate degree from Thiel College and went on to earn his Juris Doctorate from the University of Kentucky. After law school, he practiced law while serving as a solicitor in Newton Falls and the Village of Orangeville. He then became a prosecutor and practiced criminal defense in Warren Ohio. In 1983, he was appointed to the Central District Court in Cortland and later to the Common Pleas bench in 1991.
Judge Stuard is affectionately known as a gentleman's gentleman, he recognizes that his judgment needs to hold people accountable for their actions, yet must not lose touch with the utility of punishment. While not on the bench, Judge Stuard is a member of the Hartford Optimists, Trumbull Farm Bureau, Conservation Club and he is an avid Civil War enthusiast.
I want to extend my warmest thanks to Judge John M. Stuard for his life's devotion to serving the people of Trumbull County.

The Eagle Scout rank is the highest advancement rank in scouting. Only about five percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout Award. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards that have been well-maintained over the past century.
To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass specific tests that are organized by requirements and merit badges, as well as completing an Eagle Project to benefit the community. Avery and Colin completed their projects at Lime Creek Nature Center by constructing numerous bird houses, placing fire pits, and clearing brush. The work ethic Avery and Colin have shown in their Eagle Projects, and every other project leading up to their Eagle Scout ranks, speaks volumes of their commitment to serving a cause greater than themselves and assisting their community.
Mr. Speaker, the example set by these young men and their supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication and perseverance.

325,MA.MCGOVERN,MA,McGovern,"Mr. Speaker, after Senator George McGovern's passing last October, Colman McCarthy wrote a wonderful tribute about this man of peace.
I would like to submit his article. I urge all my colleagues to continue to work for the causes so dear to Senator McGovern's heart.
On the Wednesday afternoon in early November 1972 after his defeat the day before by Richard Nixon for the presidency, George McGovern and his wife, Eleanor, arrived at Washington's National Airport. The loss had been nearly total, with McGovern, a liberal populist Democrat from South Dakota, winning only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia. By chance, his running mate, Sargent Shriver, was arriving at the same time from another plane. They came upon each other in the main concourse. Seeing a dejected McGovern, with his wife in tears about losing even their home state, Shriver offered a powerful consoling line: ``George, we may have lost the election but we certainly didn't lose our soul.'' Within three years, Nixon, a scheming and deceitful politician who spared nothing in his depiction of McGovern as an unpatriotic ultraliberal, would resign in disgrace over the Watergate scandal. At his death in late October 2012, McGovern remained in full possession of the soul-force that marked a political career that began in the House of Representatives in 1956 and ended in the Senate in 1980. I recall a conversation once when he laughed about Republicans' portrait of him as a wild leftist, wondering how he managed to win House and Senate races in South Dakota, one of the country's most conservative states. His liberalism knew a boundary or two. He had little regard for the showmen of the 1960s anti-war movement--from Abbie Hoffman to Jerry Rubin--and saw them as ineffectual clowns. McGovern's passions ranged from opposition to the Vietnam War to advocating for nutrition programs for the hungry in this country and abroad. He advocated for small farmers as they saw their lands swallowed by corporate agribusiness. He stood with the tribal nations, a stance so firm that the Oglala Sioux of South Dakota called him ``the Great White Eagle.'' McGovern first visited South Vietnam in late 1965, a visit that confirmed his hunch that the war was doomed. The year before, he voted in favor of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which gave a pass to President Lyndon Johnson to escalate the war after an attack by North Vietnam on an American patrol boat--an attack that never happened. It was a vote McGovern would eventually be ashamed of missing the chance to join Wayne Morse and Ernest Gruening as the only two members of the Senate to say no. Perhaps to compensate for the lapse, McGovern became the strongest antiwar voice in the Senate. His military record of personal bravery--he flew more than 30 high-risk bombing missions in the Second World War--gave him credibility. In a Sept. 1, 1970, floor debate on his amendment, co-sponsored with Mark Hatfield, to end the war, McGovern said: Every senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave. This chamber reeks of blood. Every senator here is partly responsible for that human wreckage at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval [hospitals] and all across our land--young men without legs, or arms, or genitals, or faces, or hopes. There are not very many of these blasted and broken boys who think this war is a glorious adventure. Do not talk to them about bugging out, or national honor, or courage. It does not take any courage at all for a congressman, or a senator, or a president to wrap himself in the flag and say we are staying in--Vietnam, because it is not our blood that is being shed. But we are responsible for those young men and their lives and their hopes. The grandson of Irish immigrants and the son of a Methodist pastor, McGovern suffered tragedy in his personal life. The story is told in Terry: My Daughter's Life-and-Death Struggle With Alcoholism, Published in 1996, two years after Teresa McGovern, 45, froze to death in a snowbank in Madison, Wis., after a night of drinking, it is the most soulful of his half-dozen books: a lovingly written work blended with self- therapy and spirituality. My last visit with McGovern came a few years ago when he spoke on a Sunday afternoon to a small gathering at a civic center in the Friendship Heights neighborhood of Chevy Chase, Md. I brought Shriver to the talk. It was a touching reunion of the two former running mates. Shriver, sinking slowly into Alzheimer's disease, had no memory of McGovern, much less of their campaigning decades ago. But the two, both giants of service and goodness, embraced each other with deep affection, leaving me and other onlookers to wonder what kind of country we might have become if the election of 1972 had gone the other way. A more humane country? A country at peace with the world? A country loved globally for its generosity, not hated or feared for its belligerence? Little time was needed for wondering about the obvious answers to those questions.",MA,MCGOVERN,-0.545,D,mr speaker senat georg mcgovern pass last octob colman mccarthi wrote wonder tribut man peac would like submit articl urg colleagu continu work caus dear senat mcgovern heart wednesday afternoon earli novemb 1972 defeat day richard nixon presid georg mcgovern wife eleanor arriv washington nation airport loss nearli total mcgovern liber populist democrat south dakota win massachusett district columbia chanc run mate sargent shriver arriv time anoth plane came upon main concours see deject mcgovern wife tear lose even home state shriver offer power consol line georg may lost elect certainli didnt lose soul within three year nixon scheme deceit politician spare noth depict mcgovern unpatriot ultraliber would resign disgrac waterg scandal death late octob 2012 mcgovern remain full possess soulforc mark polit career began hous repres 1956 end senat 1980 recal convers laugh republican portrait wild leftist wonder manag win hous senat race south dakota one countri conserv state liber knew boundari two littl regard showmen 1960 antiwar movementfrom abbi hoffman jerri rubinand saw ineffectu clown mcgovern passion rang opposit vietnam war advoc nutrit program hungri countri abroad advoc small farmer saw land swallow corpor agribusi stood tribal nation stanc firm oglala sioux south dakota call great white eagl mcgovern first visit south vietnam late 1965 visit confirm hunch war doom year vote favor gulf tonkin resolut gave pass presid lyndon johnson escal war attack north vietnam american patrol boatan attack never happen vote mcgovern would eventu asham miss chanc join wayn mors ernest gruen two member senat say perhap compens laps mcgovern becam strongest antiwar voic senat militari record person braveryh flew 30 highrisk bomb mission second world wargav credibl sept 1 1970 floor debat amend cosponsor mark hatfield end war mcgovern said everi senat chamber partli respons send 50 000 young american earli grave chamber reek blood everi senat partli respons human wreckag walter reed bethesda naval hospit across landyoung men without leg arm genit face hope mani blast broken boy think war gloriou adventur talk bug nation honor courag take courag congressman senat presid wrap flag say stay invietnam blood shed respons young men live hope grandson irish immigr son methodist pastor mcgovern suffer tragedi person life stori told terri daughter lifeanddeath struggl alcohol publish 1996 two year teresa mcgovern 45 froze death snowbank madison wi night drink soul halfdozen book lovingli written work blend self therapi spiritu last visit mcgovern came year ago spoke sunday afternoon small gather civic center friendship height neighborhood chevi chase md brought shriver talk touch reunion two former run mate shriver sink slowli alzheim diseas memori mcgovern much less campaign decad ago two giant servic good embrac deep affect leav onlook wonder kind countri might becom elect 1972 gone way human countri countri peac world countri love global generos hate fear belliger littl time need wonder obviou answer question
326,MS.THOMPSON,MS,Thompson,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 22-year-old young man from Shaw, Mississippi. Jacques Alexander Marquis Matthews has answered the call of duty to his country and is currently serving as an active soldier in the Mississippi National Guard stationed in Afghanistan.
Specialist Matthews comes from a lineage filled with military servicemen and women. His paternal grandfather, Mr. William Carter, is a Vietnam Veteran who served in the United States Air Force; his maternal uncle, Mr. James Attaway, served in the United States Marines; and his mother, Ramona Matthews, had just enlisted in the United States Army when she learned she was pregnant with her first child, Jacques.
Specialist Matthews was raised in a single parent home by his mother, Ramona, along with his two younger brothers, Chauncey and Malik. Specialist Matthews understood the pain of his mother as she struggled to provide for them and the reproach of his grandparents, William and Alicestean Carter and Susie Matthews. As his mother's oldest child, much was expected of him and he wanted to fulfill those expectations. But like many other young men, what appears to be quick and easy was tempting. And sometimes he was prey to those temptations. In fact he said and I quote, ``my mother was more determined than me--for me to succeed. So, she snatched me from that wrong path and told me my life had three paths it could take and I had to choose one right then, college, military, or she was going to commit a homicide and that's all I needed to know. Needless to say, I chose the military.''
Mr. Speaker, Specialist Matthews has a litany of highlights during his military career including:
In 2008: Specialist Matthews enlisted in the Mississippi National Guard.
August 2008-October 2008: Specialist Matthews did his basic training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina.
October 2008: Specialist Matthews completed his basic training. He was recognized during graduation for having scored a perfect 300 on the physical fitness portion of the training.
July 10, 2010-July 31, 2010: Specialist Matthews was a member of the 2089th Vertical Company, 223rd Engineer Battalion. He received the Army Achievement Medal for his Superior and Unflagging Support of his unit.
November 6, 2010: Specialist Matthews was honored with the Commanders Award for scoring 297 on the Annual Army Physical Fitness Test while he was a member of the 223rd Engineer Battalion.
November 7, 2010: Specialist Matthews while in the 168th Engineer Brigade received the Silver Castle Challenge Certificate of Achievement for having completed the Army Physical Fitness test with a score of 297. He was recognized for distinguishing himself by his excellent conditioning. He is truly to be commended for the accomplishment and deserving of the recognition for his sacrifice and self-discipline.
May 2011: Specialist Matthews was in the 2089th Vertical Construction Company when he was honored with the Army Meritorious Achievement Medal for his selfless service, loyalty and honor, dedication and integrity as an example for all to follow for his significant contribution to the success of his unit and the Mississippi Army National Guard.
October 2011-November 2011: Specialist Matthews received the Meritorious Service Award in recognition of his superior physical ability during the annual training while assigned to Detachment 1 of the 2089th Vertical Construction Company.
May 7, 2012: Specialist Matthews' unit, the 2089th Vertical Construction Company, 223rd Engineer Battalion was activated to Afghanistan.
I want Specialist Matthews' story to serve as one of encouragement to those who think there is no hope for change and to those who prejudge someone because of their circumstances. Specialist Matthews has expressed great interest in building an exciting career in the military answering the call at home and abroad whenever and wherever he is needed.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Specialist Jacques Alexander Marquis Matthews, from the Second Congressional District of Mississippi, now serving as a member of the Mississippi National Guard currently stationed in Afghanistan. As he so proudly represents the United States, I too am proud to represent him as a Member of Congress. I wish him a continued rewarding military career and a safe return home to the United States.

327,OH.STIVERS,OH,Stivers,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Village Administrator Ed VanVickle and Mayor Eric Sandine of Lithopolis, Ohio, for their heroic efforts to fix a water main break that left half of the village without water.
In most cities, a water main break would mean hiring someone else to fix it, but in Lithopolis, Mayor Sandine has made unconventional, but necessary, cuts to save money. Now he and Mr. VanVickle roll up their sleeves and do the dirty work themselves, even though it is not part of their job descriptions. With no more than household plumbing experience, these men were able to fix the water main break in freezing temperatures.
On top of fixing the water lines, these men, along with the village's maintenance crew, fix sewer lines and pot holes. They even go as far as operating snow plows and the water treatment plant.
These two men represent what it means to be a true leader. They do not do this extra work for money or recognition. Instead, they do what is best for their community because it is what they believe is the right thing to do.

328,CA.CAMPBELL,CA,Campbell,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Carl Everett Drake, Sr. who died peacefully of natural causes at his home in Sacramento on December 27, 2012. He was 99.
Carl Drake was born on August 21, 1913 in Neptune New Jersey, the second son of James and Lucy Bingham Drake. Carl was educated in the public schools where he was an outstanding student, and even better multisport athlete. His state high school long jump mark of 21'10'' stood for over 25 years. His talents brought him to the attention of coaches from Morgan State College in Baltimore, MD the top ranked college football program available to African American players in the 1930s. His combination of size, speed and ferocity won him a starting spot on the championship football team. At 6'1'' and 205 lbs., huge at the time, he was a bruising, standout guard, playing both offense and defense. The team went undefeated for his entire career. He was team captain, had the honor of wearing jersey number one, and held the team ball in the national championship photos.
At Morgan he was active in several student organizations, including the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, which he joined in 1933. He began dating an attractive and studious coed who worked as the Dean's secretary, even joining the glee club to demonstrate to her his ``softer'' side. Carl and Beatrice Hayes were married in September 1937. They settled in Baltimore, she began work as a social worker, and he, having left school after football a few credits short of graduation, took a job in the post office. Professional football was not available, but his training made him valuable at handling mail sacks. Two children Carl Jr. (1939) and Beatrice (1940) followed, along with a chronic back injury that led to a job shift that relied more on his college schooling than his strength. Ruled out of active military service due to his back injury, he re-enrolled in school to complete his college degree, and in 1944, at the urging of Bea, applied to medical school. He could not attend the segregated University of Maryland, but under the ``separate but equal'' concept of Jim Crow laws, the state of Maryland instead paid his tuition to attend Meharry Medical College, in Nashville Tennessee, one of the two medical schools in the county to educate more than the occasional person of color.
He moved to Nashville to begin study, working an 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. graveyard shift as a hospital orderly to save enough money to send for his wife and family, which he was able to do by 1946. He finished Meharry in 1949, and moved to New York City to begin internship at Harlem Hospital. He had wanted to return to Baltimore, but the city hospital there paid interns $15 per month with free room. Harlem paid $50 per month, enough to rent a one bedroom apartment for the family. After internship, and a new baby (Michael 1950), The family moved across the George Washington Bridge to Englewood, New Jersey. Carl began his life as a working physician with a grueling schedule that consisted of steady employment in the ER at Harlem hospital, graveyard shift, 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., followed by a junior partnership in a local New York physician's office from 9 to noon, then home to Jersey to sleep, dinner at 6, and then a few private patients seen in a room converted to a makeshift medical office in the house until 9, before returning to work for the 11 p.m. shift in Harlem. When asked later about this level of commitment he replied that he was mainly ``grateful for a chance to actually work''.
This schedule was of course unsustainable, and a fascination with the newly emerging field of psychiatry led him to, at 40, begin training in psychiatry at Graystone State Hospital. During residency he continued his home office practice after dinner to help support a family that had grown to four children with the addition of Barry in 1952. In 1957, after completing residency he looked nationally, and made the bold decision to move to Sacramento to join a newly burgeoning state mental health system. Prior to this no one in the family had ever been west of Tennessee. Arriving in Sacramento in July 1958, he worked for the state during the day, and as had always been the case set up a small private practice in rented space in the evenings. Financial obligations included supporting a son in college and stiff mortgage payment on a modern house in an upscale, and for the first time integrated, neighborhood.
In Sacramento Carl and Bea joined a small circle of middle class African Americans, who had also moved west to make a new life. A handful of doctors, lawyers, a defense contractor, and a funeral home owner formed a social group anchored by the ``Couples Club'', which met on Saturdays once a month for a rotating house party. There were also civic activities like the Lions Club, competitive chess, and the NAACP, as well as the local chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha, Inc. The names of these pioneers: Colley, Jones, Morris, Morrissey, Nance, Rutland, Stewart, Trent, West, and a few others, are now a part of Sacramento history. In 1967 a reduction in state supported mental health services affected clinics, including the Sacramento branch where Carl was Chief of Psychiatry. The new Medicare and Medicaid programs made private practice more viable for physicians caring for low income patients. He converted to full time private practice, and the late 1960s and 1970s became a time of relative prosperity. A pool was added to the backyard, and Carl learned, for the first time, to swim. He remained health conscious, and he and Bea were in the pool everyday from May to October until they were both in their 90s.
With the children finally grown and on their own Carl and Bea travelled--Alaska, Mexico, Hawaii and Scandinavia were highlights--entertained friends, and watched their ever expanding cadre of grandchildren and great grandchildren grow. Bea retired in 1975, but Carl kept his active practice going, seeing patients five days a week until he was 90. Bea suffered from mild macular degeneration and progressive Alzheimer's disease, ultimately requiring full time supervision. Carl closed his practice--regretfully--to come home to care for her. He moved from many patients to just one. They continued to play backgammon as long as she could, exercised in the pool, and when that was no longer safe took walks around the courtyard, until Bea passed away in March 2008. They had been married for just over 70 years.
In the months following Bea's death Carl, now 94, began a series of home refurbishing projects including a new roof and painting inside and out. His oldest grandson John, a professional house painter, came north to help, and ultimately moved in to help manage the house and yard. In August 2008 Carl renewed his medical license and his driver's license as he put it ``just in case''. He became active in his fraternity once again. He did a few legal consultations in 2009, and then with John to type reports on the new computer, began seeing patients again, on a regular basis, working for the State of California as he had when he moved to Sacramento in 1958, this time doing disability evaluations. He pulled the office shingle bearing the name ``Carl E. Drake, Sr. MD'' from the garage (the same shingle used at the house in New Jersey 60 years ago) and mounted it near the back door. The kitchen table became his consultation office. He scheduled a light but steady stream of patients, three or four a week. He saw his last patient on December 12, 2012, before taking a break for the holidays. New visits were on the books for January 2013.
On December 26th all four of his children, along with five grandchildren and two daughters-in-law visited without fanfare for a traditional post-Christmas gathering. He was in great spirits, holding court, albeit with less energy than usual. On the 27th after a light dinner he walked into the living room to sit in his favorite easy chair and watch a few bowl games. He dosed off, never to wake again.
Dr. Carl Drake left this life as he lived it, with great dignity and grace. He came through the depression, was an All-American athlete, educated himself, raised a family, and was an active working psychiatrist until the very last days of a life that spanned the 20th century and more. He was calm, open, and cheerful, always. His physical stature was imposing, but his gentle steadfastness and serenity were the traits that made him a joy to be with. He never raised his voice; he never needed to. He was universally admired, respected, and loved. He is survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, 17 great grandchildren, 16 great-great grandchildren, and thousands of patients. He lived to see his 100th Christmas; he leaves the world a better place.",CA,CAMPBELL,1.044,R,mr speaker rise today pay tribut dr carl everett drake sr die peac natur caus home sacramento decemb 27

329,VA.WOLF,VA,Wolf,"Mr. Speaker, today I am joining with my colleague Rep. Anna G. Eshoo in reintroducing legislation to create a special envoy position at the State Department to advocate on behalf of vulnerable religious minorities in the Middle East and South Central Asia.
In countries like Iraq and Egypt, ancient Christian communities are being driven from the lands they have inhabited for centuries. In Iran, Baha'is are imprisoned and some cases executed simply because of their faith. In Pakistan, Ahmadi graves are desecrated. In Afghanistan, a country where America has sacrificed greatly in both blood and treasure, the most basic right to freedom of religion or belief is not recognized in the constitution. This is but a snap shot of the grave challenges facing these communities.
If the international community fails to speak out, the prospects for religious pluralism and tolerance in the region are bleak.
Last Congress the House, to its credit, overwhelmingly passed, by a vote of 402-20, bipartisan legislation, H.R. 440, to create a special envoy position at the State Department charged with focusing on the plight of religious minorities in these regions. Sadly, in the face of State Department opposition, the Senate failed to act.
There is a historic precedent for special envoys--including the Sudan special envoy and the North Korea human rights special envoy--whose positions were created in response to an urgent need for focused attention on a critical issue. The dire challenges facing Coptic Christians, Baha'is, Chaldo-Assyrians, Ahmadis, the small remaining Jewish population and countless other religions minorities throughout the Middle East and South Central Asia is surely such an issue.
While there is no guarantee that a special envoy will be able to single-handedly solve the problem, it certainly cannot hurt to have a high-level person within the State Department bureaucracy who is exclusively focused on the protection and preservation of these ancient communities. Such an envoy would send an important message to both our own foreign policy establishment and to suffering communities in the Middle East and elsewhere that religious freedom is a priority--that America will be a voice for the voiceless.
President Reagan once said that the U.S. Constitution is ``a covenant that we have made not only with ourselves, but with all of mankind.'' I believe the United States has an obligation to speak out for the voiceless around the world and urge my colleagues to join me cosponsoring this critical legislation.",VA,WOLF,0.511,R,mr speaker today join colleagu rep anna g eshoo reintroduc legisl creat special envoy posit state depart advoc behalf vulner religi minor middl east south central asia countri like iraq egypt ancient christian commun driven land inhabit centuri iran bahai imprison case execut simpli faith pakistan ahmadi grave desecr afghanistan countri america sacrif greatli blood treasur basic right freedom religion belief recogn constitut snap shot grave challeng face commun intern commun fail speak prospect religi plural toler region bleak last congress hous credit overwhelmingli pass vote 40220 bipartisan legisl h r 440 creat special envoy posit state depart charg focus plight religi minor region sadli face state depart opposit senat fail act histor preced special envoysinclud sudan special envoy north korea human right special envoywhos posit creat respons urgent need focus attent critic issu dire challeng face coptic christian bahai chaldoassyrian ahmadi small remain jewish popul countless religion minor throughout middl east south central asia sure issu guarante special envoy abl singlehandedli solv problem certainli cannot hurt highlevel person within state depart bureaucraci exclus focus protect preserv ancient commun envoy would send import messag foreign polici establish suffer commun middl east elsewher religi freedom prioritythat america voic voiceless presid reagan said u constitut coven made mankind believ unit state oblig speak voiceless around world urg colleagu join cosponsor critic legisl

A retired fire captain on leave from Afghanistan for the holidays, he was sick and unable to sleep at 3 a.m. that morning. Going outside, he noticed the home of Brandy Middlemiss collecting smoke. Moving quickly into action, he successfully alerted Brandy and her two children, Patrick and Lynzee, guiding them safely away from the fire. 
In doing so, Jefferson demonstrated great bravery, instinct and skill when he saved the lives of Brandy, Patrick and Lynzee. For his efforts, Jefferson was awarded the New York State Senate Liberty medal, one of the highest civilian honors a New Yorker can receive.
His actions are nothing short of heroic, demonstrating the best in our citizenry through selflessness and courage.

332,NC.MCINTYRE,NC,McIntyre,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Charles Chrestman, of Lumberton, North Carolina, for his commitment and service to his community. Dr. Chrestman retired from his position as President of Robeson Community College on December 31, 2012, but his legacy of dedicated leadership in education will stay strong for generations to come. Dr. Chrestman has not only been a steward to higher education in Robeson County, but a trusted advisor and dear friend.
Dr. Chrestman's colleagues acknowledge the remarkable progress the college has made during his decade of service as President. During his tenure, Dr. Chrestman worked to reaffirm Robeson Community College's status as a nationally accredited institution. He also helped oversee the creation of three new buildings on campus: a Continuing Education building, a Health Science building, and a Workforce Development Center. Two others were completely renovated. The College also landed one of the state's NCCCS Biotechnology Network regional centers that now serves a statewide role in advancing bio-agriculture.
Dr. Chrestman's dream was to see all graduates become productive laborers within the community and the great state of North Carolina. During his tenure, Robeson Community College began offering the ACT's WorkKeys Assessment, which leads to a Career Readiness Certificate. Today, Robeson County ranks in the top three among the state's 100 counties with more than 5,000 individuals holding the certificate. These and many other accomplishments are a testament to Dr. Chrestman's leadership.
I am personally grateful to Dr. Chrestman for his service as Chairman of my Education Advisory Committee, a small group of education leaders from the seventh congressional district of North Carolina who regularly meet to discuss education issues affecting our communities. His leadership in this capacity has been invaluable to me, and I will remain thankful.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Dr. Charles Chrestman's forty years in higher education as he retires as President of Robeson Community College.

336,VA.WOLF,VA,Wolf,"Mr. Speaker, today I am reintroducing legislation that would create a permanent inspector general for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA).
My bill would amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 by creating a special post with the sole duty of providing long term oversight of MWAA. Only the U.S. Secretary of Transportation can appoint and remove the IG and no additional action from any jurisdiction on the state or local level is required for this position to be established. In addition, MWAA would be required to pay for the IG using its revenues, not taxpayer dollars.
I am reintroducing this legislation because I believe that due to the continued growth of the Dulles corridor, the Dulles rail project is the most important transportation project in the Commonwealth. It must be completed on time and at, or under, budget.
I appreciate Secretary Ray LaHood appointing an accountability officer to monitor the MWAA, but it is clear this entity, which is responsible for overseeing the entire construction of the Dulles rail project, requires a permanent IG to provide long term oversight of its actions.",VA,WOLF,0.511,R,mr speaker today reintroduc legisl would creat perman inspector gener metropolitan washington airport author mwaa bill would amend inspector gener act 1978 creat special post sole duti provid long term oversight mwaa u secretari transport appoint remov ig addit action jurisdict state local level requir posit establish addit mwaa would requir pay ig use revenu taxpay dollar reintroduc legisl believ due continu growth dull corridor dull rail project import transport project commonwealth must complet time budget appreci secretari ray lahood appoint account offic monitor mwaa clear entiti respons overse entir construct dull rail project requir perman ig provid long term oversight action
337,OH.TIBERI,OH,Tiberi,"Mr. Speaker, my colleague Congressman Steve Stivers and I are pleased to congratulate James Gilbert upon the completion of his service as president of the Fraternal Order of Police.
For the past six years, the citizens of the Greater Columbus area and the law enforcement officers of the Columbus Police Department have received unparalleled service and leadership from Jim Gilbert. His dedication has been illustrated through his many hospital visits to every officer injured in the line of duty and his commitment to personally coaching officers through the emotional process associated with using their weapons in the line of duty.
Jim Gilbert's talents are so well respected that even the most contentious issues between his membership and the city of Columbus have been resolved with no disruption to department operations. His tenure saw no layoffs of personnel in spite of hard economic circumstances. He has often been called upon to aid other officers and/or their families in tragic circumstances and received great praise for his attention to the needs of injured or fallen comrades.
The Fraternal Order of Police will miss Jim Gilbert's presence and influence, but will continue to rely on his continued service as a patrolman in his new assignment. His legacy will remain with the officers he has mentored, and Franklin County residents can rest assured knowing their streets will be under his watch as he returns to his duties as an officer.
We offer our best wishes to Jim Gilbert and his family during this transition in his career.

The health of the airports and the Dulles Metrorail Extension project have an enormous impact on northern Virginia. I have often said that the Dulles corridor is the ``main street'' of Virginia. The number of businesses that have chosen to locate in this region is a testament to the strength of the airports and the services it provides as a hub for national and international travel. The success of the Dulles corridor, northern Virginia and the entire Commonwealth depend on MWAA being able to capably run the airports and the rail project.
I firmly believe that it is in the best interest of Virginia residents for the Commonwealth to have a majority of seats on the MWAA board to ensure that the airports continue to thrive, Dulles Rail is completed successfully and the Dulles Corridor will continue to be the economic engine of not only the National Capital Region, but the entire Commonwealth of Virginia.

340,AL.BACHUS,AL,Bachus,"Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to have this opportunity to recognize the distinguished career and civic accomplishments of JDanny Cooper on the occasion of his retirement as the Executive Vice President of the Alabama Association of REALTORS.
If there are three words that one would associate with JDanny, they would be service, integrity, and friendship. These qualities have helped him to be successful in all of his fields of endeavor and, in turn, have made the individuals and organizations that he has worked for successful in their own right.
JDanny was named AAR's Executive Vice President in 1989 and developed a reputation for providing steady and wise leadership and promoting responsible home ownership. JDanny's advocacy of high standards and ethical practices has benefited countless homeowners throughout the State of Alabama, creating stronger neighborhoods and communities.
In 2002 and again in 2005, JDanny served as the first Association Executive appointed as a Committee Liaison by the President of the National Association of REALTORS. He has made presentations to 17 state associations to share successes achieved by the AAR. His contributions were honored nationally in 2004 when he was inducted into the Dr. Almon R. (Bud) Smith Association Executive Leadership Society.
As a citizen, JDanny has always believed in one's civic duty to actively participate in our governing process. He has served as a member of the Governor's cabinet, as the State Director for a United States Senator, as the executive director of a state political party, and as a state manager for a presidential campaign.
Education has been another of JDanny's enduring passions. JDanny holds a bachelor's degree in Political Science and History as well as a Masters of Education degree in Administration from the University of Montevallo. A former schoolteacher and director of a university's Veterans Affairs office, JDanny was named the University of Montevallo's Alumnus of the Year in 2003 and currently serves on the Board of Trustees.
JDanny gives his time to many professional boards and organizations, including the Board of Trustees of the Alabama Center for Real Estate, the Business Association's Tax Coalition, the Business Council of Alabama, and the Alabama Civil Justice Reform Commission. He is a member of the American Society of Association Executives. A volunteer fundraiser for the American Village, he is the Governor's Representative on the American Village Cornerstone of Liberty Commission.
JDanny would be the first to credit his success to the support of his loving family. He and his wife Dianne have two sons, Jay and Robin, and two wonderful granddaughters, Caroline and Ella Kate, through Jay and his wife Susan. In March, Robin will marry the love of his life, Morgan Hightower.
There are not many people you can think of that are known by their first name alone, but JDanny Cooper is one of them. He has achieved that distinction by being a listener, a leader, and a source of inspiration for the many privileged to know him. It is fitting and proper to have JDanny's contributions to the State of Alabama and our country recorded in the annals of the U.S. House of Representatives.",AL,BACHUS,0.565,R,mr speaker pleasur opportun recogn distinguish career civic accomplish jdanni cooper occas retir execut vice presid alabama associ realtor three word one would associ jdanni would servic integr friendship qualiti help success field endeavor turn made individu organ work success right jdanni name aar execut vice presid 1989 develop reput provid steadi wise leadership promot respons home ownership jdanni advocaci high standard ethic practic benefit countless homeown throughout state alabama creat stronger neighborhood commun 2002 2005 jdanni serv first associ execut appoint committe liaison presid nation associ realtor made present 17 state associ share success achiev aar contribut honor nation 2004 induct dr almon r bud smith associ execut leadership societi citizen jdanni alway believ one civic duti activ particip govern process serv member governor cabinet state director unit state senat execut director state polit parti state manag presidenti campaign educ anoth jdanni endur passion jdanni hold bachelor degre polit scienc histori well master educ degre administr univers montevallo former schoolteach director univers veteran affair offic jdanni name univers montevallo alumnu year 2003 current serv board truste jdanni give time mani profession board organ includ board truste alabama center real estat busi associ tax coalit busi council alabama alabama civil justic reform commiss member american societi associ execut volunt fundrais american villag governor repres american villag cornerston liberti commiss jdanni would first credit success support love famili wife diann two son jay robin two wonder granddaught carolin ella kate jay wife susan march robin marri love life morgan hightow mani peopl think known first name alon jdanni cooper one achiev distinct listen leader sourc inspir mani privileg know fit proper jdanni contribut state alabama countri record annal u hous repres
341,KY.ROGERS,KY,Rogers,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the director and members of the Letcher County Central High School marching band, who have received the honor of performing in Washington, DC, for the 57th Presidential Inaugural Parade on January 21, 2013. This talented group of students should be proud of this remarkable achievement and I am honored to recognize their success.
Competing with more than 2,800 applicants to perform during the parade following President Barack Obama's inauguration, Letcher County Central marching band was one of merely 24 groups chosen for this prestigious honor. After weeks of hard work, fundraising, and practicing in the cold, the band members will serve as the only representative from Kentucky to march in the Presidential Inauguration Parade this year. The band will also be joined by the school's ROTC Cadet Honor Guard performing a ``Patriotic Parade Sequence,'' a medley of American songs, after President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are sworn into office. The marching band was also invited to perform at the Kentucky Society of Washington DC's Inaugural Ball on January 19, 2013.
Contrary to their current success, the Letcher County Central High School music program has not always had a strong presence on campus. In fact, in 2006, the instrumental music program at Letcher County Central High School did not exist. However, with the help of Dr. Jason Griffith, Director of the LCCHS marching band, and several VH1 Save the Music Grants, the program has grown from 50 kids to approximately 400 kids in just six years. Today, the band has received numerous awards such as a Kennedy Center Honorable Mention, and has participated in prominent parades such as the Gubernatorial Parades in Kentucky in 2007 and 2011 and a special parade at Disney World in 2012.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Band Director Jason Griffith and the Letcher County Central High School Marching Band.

342,FL.MILLER,FL,Miller,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Northwest Florida's beloved Colonel James L. Hill, Sr. Colonel Hill was a native Northwest Floridian who served his nation with honor and distinction, while also working tirelessly as an educator and leader in his community.
Colonel Hill was born in the small town of Lakewood in Walton County, Florida on February 1, 1925. Colonel Hill attended public schools in Walton County, before graduating from Tivoli High School in DeFuniak Springs, Florida. After his high school career, Colonel Hill began his studies at Florida A&M University.
Colonel Hill put his studies on hold, however, to answer the call of duty during World War II. Colonel Hill entered the United States Army as a Private, serving bravely in the European Theater. After the war ended, Colonel Hill returned to his studies at Florida A&M University; however, he decided to remain in the Army Reserve to continue serving his nation.
After graduating from Florida A&M, Colonel Hill married his college sweetheart, Jounice, and together they accepted positions at Carver Junior High School in Florala, Alabama. Colonel Hill was working as the Principal of Carver Junior High, when he was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. Colonel Hill was ready to answer his nation's call, and he again served with honor and distinction with the 45th Combat Infantry.
Colonel Hill finished his tour in Korea and returned to Northwest Florida to continue his career in education. He took a position as the Principal of Drew Elementary School in Baker, Florida. His successful tenure at Drew was the beginning of an exemplary career that saw Colonel Hill serve as a principal at four different schools in Okaloosa County, Florida including 26 years at Florosa Elementary School.
While serving in the Army Reserve and as a school principal, Colonel Hill also continued his education receiving both a master's and doctorate degree in education. Colonel Hill also excelled in his reserve service, and in 1975, after completing Command and General Staff College, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel. Colonel Hill continued to serve in the Army Reserve until his retirement in 1981. In 1994, Colonel Hill retired from the Okaloosa County School District after having worked as a teacher and principal for nearly 40 years, and his excellent service to the State of Florida was recognized with a gubernatorial proclamation from Governor Lawton Chiles.
Outside of his outstanding leadership as an educator and a member of our Armed Forces, Colonel Hill was also a true leader in the Northwest Florida community. Colonel Hill served as President of the Community Action Program in Fort Walton Beach, as well as Vice President of the Fort Walton Beach Civic League. He was also a longtime member of the Okaloosa County NAACP, and in 2009 he was recognized as the Okaloosa County Branch NAACP Centennial Celebration Legacy Honoree. Colonel Hill's outstanding achievements and legacy were also recorded for posterity in his autobiography Sawmill, A Family Affair, which won the Palm Beach County African Diaspora Award.
To some, Colonel James Hill will be remembered as a patriot, who answered the call of duty on numerous occasions with honor, distinction and bravery. To others, he will be remembered as a committed educator and a leader in civic society.

343,NY.BISHOP,NY,Bishop,"Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, colleague and fellow New Yorker for yielding time. I'd also like to thank Representatives Lowey and King for their leadership; and I commend my colleagues in the New York and New Jersey delegations on both sides of the aisle for working so well together to advance the interests of our states at this critical time. I rise to support the rule and urge my colleagues to support H.R. 152, and the Frelinghuysen Amendment, and to oppose the Mulvaney Amendment.
It has been two-and-a-half months since Superstorm Sandy hit communities in New York, New Jersey, and neighboring states which continue to face the almost insurmountable task of cleaning up and rebuilding homes, businesses, and lives. I'm grateful we finally have the opportunity to consider a relief package to help those who are most in need.
On the eastern half of Long Island, businesses, farms, and homes fell victim to intense flooding; ferocious winds caused substantial damage to property, vehicles, and businesses; and along the coast, Sandy created breaches in the coastline and severely eroded other beaches. In New York and New Jersey, at least 651,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and approximately 463,000 businesses were impacted. 
I must observe this has been a painfully protracted process; it is a fact that what we've tried to accomplish for the last two-and-a-half months had once been considered a common-sense, bipartisan response to natural disasters. And the calls for offsets and a slower pace of funding in the wake of natural disasters are a recent phenomenon, even though previous Congresses quickly supported measures that provided relief to affected states.
For example, within two weeks of Hurricane Katrina, Congress provided $70 billion in disaster funding to the Gulf Coast with great bipartisan support, and with virtually no discussion about how to pay for it. Congress recognized this was a major disaster, people were hurting, and it had to act to alleviate the suffering.
Congress, with bipartisan support, continued to appropriate emergency funds for various Katrina projects and activities totaling $120 billion, all without payfors. For example, Congress funded $1 billion to build a retractable seawall to protect New Orleans from rising storm surge. And it approved $14 billion to rebuild and upgrade critical flood prevention infrastructure to minimize, or mitigate, the risk of such devastation occurring again. Why do New York and New Jersey deserve less urgency? And why are mitigation projects for New Orleans considered prudent, and mitigation projects for New York and New Jersey characterized as pork?
Mr. Speaker, our states are not asking for anything more than help to get back on their feet and rebuild. We are asking for nothing more than to respond to this disaster as we have for Hurricane Katrina and other natural disasters that have wrought damage upon fellow Americans. I urge my colleagues to support this package without any damaging amendments.",NY,BISHOP,-0.301,D,mr speaker thank friend colleagu fellow new yorker yield time id also like thank repres lowey king leadership commend colleagu new york new jersey deleg side aisl work well togeth advanc interest state critic time rise support rule urg colleagu support h r 152 frelinghuysen amend oppos mulvaney amend twoandahalf month sinc superstorm sandi hit commun new york new jersey neighbor state continu face almost insurmount task clean rebuild home busi live im grate final opportun consid relief packag help need eastern half long island busi farm home fell victim intens flood feroci wind caus substanti damag properti vehicl busi along coast sandi creat breach coastlin sever erod beach new york new jersey least 651 000 home damag destroy approxim 463 000 busi impact must observ pain protract process fact weve tri accomplish last twoandahalf month consid commonsens bipartisan respons natur disast call offset slower pace fund wake natur disast recent phenomenon even though previou congress quickli support measur provid relief affect state exampl within two week hurrican katrina congress provid 70 billion disast fund gulf coast great bipartisan support virtual discuss pay congress recogn major disast peopl hurt act allevi suffer congress bipartisan support continu appropri emerg fund variou katrina project activ total 120 billion without payfor exampl congress fund 1 billion build retract seawal protect new orlean rise storm surg approv 14 billion rebuild upgrad critic flood prevent infrastructur minim mitig risk devast occur new york new jersey deserv less urgenc mitig project new orlean consid prudent mitig project new york new jersey character pork mr speaker state ask anyth help get back feet rebuild ask noth respond disast hurrican katrina natur disast wrought damag upon fellow american urg colleagu support packag without damag amend
344,CA.PELOSI,CA,Pelosi,"Mr. Speaker, today, the people of California mourn the passing of a political legend of unsurpassed wit, a political leader of unyielding will, and a force for progress--for women, for Democrats, for our state and our country, Carmen Warschaw.
Carmen believed in the power and promise of our democracy. She believed that politics was about people, that the political process should be a force for good, that elections should produce leaders of bold vision and strong values, courage and character. She believed all Americans bore a responsibility to participate, to vote, to make our voices heard. She believed we all had the ability and the obligation to make a difference--whether in a campaign, in our schools, or in our communities. And she never hesitated to act on her beliefs.
I was on the foundation of these principles that Carmen made her mark. It was on the basis of these values that Carmen built her legacy.
She left footprints on the lives and careers of countless political figures--as a fixture at every Democratic National Convention from 1948 to 2008; as the Democratic Party's Chairwoman in Southern California; as a power broker in state government. She was never afraid to go toe-to-toe with the most powerful people in our state, whether a governor or a state party chair. She would, in the words of her alma mater, always ``fight on.''
She was a pioneer. The daughter of immigrants, she became the first woman to lead the state's Fair Employment Practices Commission, standing firm for civil rights, equality, and justice for all.
She was a philanthropist to her core, investing in the causes of Los Angeles' Jewish community; supporting the state and people of Israel; endowing chairs and backing research at USC--the school where she met the love of her life, Louis.
She loved music and the arts, and was surrounded by them in her beautiful home. She loved sports, and could regularly be found on a hot summer day in her seat behind the home dugout at Dodger Stadium.
She was intensely loyal, fiercely independent, extraordinarily wise, and unabashedly proud of her heritage, her values, and her political activism. Indeed, it was only fitting that Carmen would pass away on November 6, 2012--Election Day. In characteristic fashion, she had already voted, leaving one last, indelible mark on history.
To borrow a phrase from Jewish tradition, Carmen Warschaw was a ``woman of valor.'' May she forever be an example of grace, passion, and commitment to all of us. May her memory be a blessing to all who knew her. May it be a comfort to her daughters, Hope and Susan, her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, her friends and loved ones to know that so many share in their grief at this time.",CA,PELOSI,-0.393,D,mr speaker today peopl california mourn pass polit legend unsurpass wit polit leader unyield forc progressfor women democrat state countri carmen warschaw carmen believ power promis democraci believ polit peopl polit process forc good elect produc leader bold vision strong valu courag charact believ american bore respons particip vote make voic heard believ abil oblig make differencewheth campaign school commun never hesit act belief foundat principl carmen made mark basi valu carmen built legaci left footprint live career countless polit figuresa fixtur everi democrat nation convent 1948 2008 democrat parti chairwoman southern california power broker state govern never afraid go toetoto power peopl state whether governor state parti chair would word alma mater alway fight pioneer daughter immigr becam first woman lead state fair employ practic commiss stand firm civil right equal justic philanthropist core invest caus lo angel jewish commun support state peopl israel endow chair back research uscth school met love life loui love music art surround beauti home love sport could regularli found hot summer day seat behind home dugout dodger stadium intens loyal fierc independ extraordinarili wise unabashedli proud heritag valu polit activ inde fit carmen would pass away novemb 6 2012elect day characterist fashion alreadi vote leav one last indel mark histori borrow phrase jewish tradit carmen warschaw woman valor may forev exampl grace passion commit us may memori bless knew may comfort daughter hope susan grandchildren greatgrandchildren friend love one know mani share grief time

346,NJ.HOLT,NJ,Holt,"Madam Chair, I rise in support of the Disaster Relief Act. This bill brings much needed aid to the residents of central New Jersey.
I am concerned that several amendments to H.R. 152 would impair the ability of money in the bill to be spent wisely. The amended bill includes a provision that would block funding that enables coastal communities to develop mitigation plans for future hurricanes and other severe weather events. We should not be limiting NOAA's ability to forecast and respond to hurricanes in an emergency appropriations bill that is designed to respond to a hurricane.
I intended to offer to H.R. 152 an amendment that would have lifted the $250,000 cap on Community Development Block Grant Funds (CDBG) that can be used by towns and municipalities to finance critically need infrastructure projects. There are towns in my district that would benefit from upgrades to existing flood management infrastructure, yet are unable to afford the costs associated with these projects. Unfortunately, my amendment was not made in order by the House Leadership.
While I support strongly passage of H.R. 152, I want to reiterate that our fellow citizens affected by Hurricane Sandy have already waited far too long for help from Congress. In other natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, Congress acted swiftly, and aid reached those in need. And yet, the 112th Congress adjourned before passing a much-needed disaster relief package. The Senate had already acted to pass a well-constructed aid package bill. The only reason that this bill is not law today is that House leadership refused to act.
This devastating storm has left many people hurting in many different ways--shopkeepers, homeowners, fishermen, hotel and restaurant owners--and has damaged the entire economy. H.R. 152 responds to this variety of needs and concerns. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.",NJ,HOLT,-0.526,D,madam chair rise support disast relief act bill bring much need aid resid central new jersey concern sever amend h r 152 would impair abil money bill spent wise amend bill includ provis would block fund enabl coastal commun develop mitig plan futur hurrican sever weather event limit noaa abil forecast respond hurrican emerg appropri bill design respond hurrican intend offer h r 152 amend would lift 250 000 cap commun develop block grant fund cdbg use town municip financ critic need infrastructur project town district would benefit upgrad exist flood manag infrastructur yet unabl afford cost associ project unfortun amend made order hous leadership support strongli passag h r 152 want reiter fellow citizen affect hurrican sandi alreadi wait far long help congress natur disast hurrican katrina congress act swiftli aid reach need yet 112th congress adjourn pass muchneed disast relief packag senat alreadi act pass wellconstruct aid packag bill reason bill law today hous leadership refus act devast storm left mani peopl hurt mani differ waysshopkeep homeown fishermen hotel restaur ownersand damag entir economi h r 152 respond varieti need concern urg colleagu support bill
347,CA.DENHAM,CA,Denham,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and honor Leadership Modesto as they celebrate 30 years of leadership education in the Central Valley.
Leadership Modesto was established in 1981 by founding Members Dave Kilby, Jeff Cowan, John Sutton, Connie Bird, Ed Boyle, Stan Hodges, Mike Zagaris and Virginia Bruch. The program was formed through the Modesto Chamber of Commerce to identify new potential Modesto leaders and to provide a ten-month program that will develop knowledge and understanding of the community--its complexities and its potential. The program also provides an opportunity for participants to meet and exchange ideas with each other and current community leaders, and to motivate and encourage participants to assume leadership roles in community affairs.
Leadership Modesto has turned out graduates such as Former Mayor James Ridenour, current Mayor Garrad Marsh, current Vice Mayor Stephanie Burnside, Modesto City Council Members Joe Muratore and Dave Cogdill Jr., and Sheriff Adam Christianson to name a few. Some of the community efforts and accomplishments--established Bette Belle Smith Day, upgraded playground equipment at JFK Elementary School, clothing drive for Professional Dress, and raised money for Camp Taylor.
The program also provides an opportunity for its members to connect, discuss and exchange ideas with each other and current community leaders, and to motivate and build strong minded leaders to assume leadership roles in our community.
Leadership Modesto is building our future and celebrating our past. Leadership Modesto is men and women with a sincere commitment, motivation and interest in serving the community. During the ten month program, members expand their understanding of Modesto and Stanislaus County through exposure to community issues many may not otherwise have the opportunity to explore at the same time enhancing leadership and management skills, and develop close relationships and mutual concerns with other class members.
Even during a down economy, the Leadership Modesto program continues to inspire public and private sector interest and participation. One of the key successes to the longevity of the Modesto program is the program leadership infrastructure--led by a committed group of Steering Committee members. Each Steering Committee member has a direct connection with one of the day topic planning teams. This direct connection enables the program to move quickly, to mobilize and respond to challenges and changes.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Leadership Modesto for 30 years of delivered premier leadership training for Modesto. More than 500 graduates pepper business and industry, elected offices, as well as non-profit volunteer boards and organizations.

348,MI.WALBERG,MI,Walberg,"Mr. Speaker, rise today to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battles at the River Raisin and pay tribute to the members of the United States Armed Forces who died during this conflict. For six days in January of 1813, U.S. soldiers fought against British forces for control of Michigan and the lower Great Lakes in a town formerly called Frenchtown, now known as Monroe.
The battle was the largest ever fought on Michigan soil. Out of more than 900 members of the United States Armed forces who fought in it, only 33 escaped death or capture. So many lives were lost that ``Remember the Raisin'' became the galvanizing battle cry for the remainder of the War.
The battlefield is a Michigan State Historic Site and has been placed on the National Register of historic places. In October 2010, the River Raisin Battlefield became part of the National Park System and remains the only National Battlefield Park representing the War of 1812.
Today I am introducing a resolution to commemorate the bicentennial of the Battles of River Raisin and to thank those who work so hard to preserve the significance of the battles for future generations. The collaborative efforts of the Monroe County Historical Society and Commission, the City of Monroe, the staff of the National Park Service and the Battlefield Visitor Center will assuredly result in a memorable remembrance of the anniversary this coming weekend.

349,CA.CALVERT,CA,Calvert,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community are exceptional. Corona and Norco have been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Yolanda Carillo is one of these individuals. On January 19, 2013, Yolanda will be honored as the ``Citizen of the Year'' at the Greater Corona Valley Chamber of Commerce Installation and Awards Gala.
Yolanda holds a dual Masters of Science degree in Organizational Leadership and Community Psychology, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Services. She previously taught at a four year college institution and is a proud holder of a Child Development Program Administrator Certificate. Currently, Yolanda serves as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Corona-Norco Family YMCA, a post she has held since 1997. She is a highly motivated community builder and hardworking professional with proven administrative and organizational abilities. Yolanda is an effective leader with a natural ability to organize the efforts and goodwill of others. She is an enthusiastic team builder who enjoys the challenge of researching and analyzing to find viable solutions to improve the lives of our children, families and communities.
Yolanda's vision has grown from one YMCA site with 12 employees to today's YMCA of nine program sites with more than 85 employees. At the same time, she has assisted children who live in poverty by securing grants worth millions of dollars from foundations, corporations, city, county, state and federal governments to establish programs for disadvantaged preschool, elementary, middle and high school students. Yolanda has also partnered with school districts, city, county and state Departments of Education as well as colleges, businesses and corporate sponsors to help underprivileged youth. The Corona-Norco Family YMCA under Yolanda's leadership has continued the successful partnership with the Calvert Foundation in sponsoring the Annual Ira D. ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Awards Dinner honoring exceptional community volunteers.
In addition to the YMCA, Yolanda is a member of many other community organizations and serves on multiple boards whose programs help children in our area. She is the City of Corona Planning Commissioner and Woman's Improvement Club Treasurer, and serves on the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, Riverside Community College District Child Development Department Advisory Board, Riverside-Corona Navy League Council Board, United Neighbors Involving Today's Youth (UNITY) Board and Corona Police Community Partnership Association Board. She is a member of the Corona Rotary Club and is the immediate past State Board Chair of the California Child Development Administrators Association.
In light of all Yolanda has done for Corona and Norco, the Greater Corona Valley Chamber of Commerce named Yolanda their Citizen of the Year. Yolanda's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Inland Empire and especially our community's children. She has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend.

351,UT.CHAFFETZ,UT,Chaffetz,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Dan Jones, Utah's most prominent political pollster, on his impressive career and service to our State. Over a 50-year period, Dr. Jones has become synonymous with Utah politics in his roles as professor, pollster, consultant, mentor, and political expert.
As President and CEO of Dan Jones & Associates, which he founded in 1980, Dr. Jones has presided over one of the Intermountain West's most highly regarded market and political research firms. Conducting polls, focus groups and surveys for a wide range of organizations, the firm's data is routinely used by Salt Lake City's print and broadcast media organizations. Dr. Jones also has a long and distinguished history of consulting on Utah's highest profile political campaigns ranging from Utah Governors Matheson, Bangerter and Leavitt to Senators Hatch, Bennett and Garn.
In addition to his work in the private sector, Dr. Jones has taught tens of thousands of Utah students over a career that has spanned five decades. He taught at both Utah State University in Logan, Utah and most recently at the University of Utah's famed Hinckley Institute of Politics. His teaching has frequently been singled out for accolades, including the Distinguished University Teaching Award in 2002, Adjunct Professor of the Year in 1999, and Students Choice for Professor of the Year in 1997.
Dr. Jones' distinguished career began after earning a Bachelor's degree at Idaho State University. Dr. Jones enlisted in the military, where he remained in Active Duty in the United States Army from 1957-1959, and was commissioned a Captain in the U.S.A.R. where he served until 1968.
Following his military service, Dr. Jones furthered his education by earning a master's degree in 1962 and doctorate degree in 1968 at the University of Utah. Following his graduate studies, Jones taught for twelve years at Utah State University and rose to the rank of full professor. After founding Dan Jones & Associates in 1980, Dr. Jones joined the faculty at the University of Utah where he was named a Hinckley Fellow in 2008. He eventually served as Interim Director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics from 2003-2005. Dr. Jones has also served for 12 years as a co-director of the Huntsman Seminar in Constitutional Government for Teachers.

352,CA.PELOSI,CA,Pelosi,"Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and deep sadness that I rise today to mourn the passing of a dear friend, an unflinching patriot, and a proud American, Samuel Keker.
The son of immigrants, born in Colorado and raised in Detroit, Sam came to our Nation's capital as a young man, as a student at American University, prepared to give back to our country and contribute to the public debate--first as a leader on campus, later as a trendsetter and a pioneer across the country.
He was a member of the ``greatest generation,'' serving in our Navy with dignity and honor in the theaters of the Atlantic and the Pacific. He remained in the Naval Reserve until 1962, even leaving his job in the private sector to return to duty in the Korean War, ultimately retiring at the rank of Commander.
He began a lifetime of work at U.S. News and World Report as an assistant in 1946 and rose through the ranks the only way he knew how: through hard work and dedication, perseverance and persistence. He would emerge as a critical leader on the business side of the magazine, promoting thoughtful, poignant, and accurate journalism, boosting circulation, and delivering the highest-quality reporting to his readers.
He would retire at the top of his profession--the Chief Executive and Chairman of his magazine--a fitting conclusion to a long, illustrious, and successful career. He was a person of great wisdom and wit.
Sam Keker's greatest source of pride was his family--his wife, Lucy; his sons, John and Jerry; his two grandsons, Adam and Nathan; and his five great-grandchildren. His life was blessed, and his legacy will be a blessing for all who knew him. We hope it is a comfort to his entire family, to his friends and loved ones that so many share in their grief at this sad time.

354,VA.WOLF,VA,Wolf,"Mr. Speaker, today I have reintroduced my resolution to establish a House Select Committee on the Terrorist Attack in Benghazi to ensure a unified investigation of the attack and the Obama Administration's response. A select committee is essential to combine the myriad existing investigations into a single, comprehensive and exhaustive review. I believe such a combined effort will yield even more information regarding the true nature of these terrorist attacks and the administration's response.
More than four months have passed since the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate and annex that occurred during the late evening and early morning hours of September 11-12. The attack took the lives of four Americans, including a U.S. ambassador--the first ambassador to be killed in the line of duty since 1979. Yet the American people still have been told little about the timeline of this attack and the administration's response in the hours, days and weeks following. Consider that the American people still haven't been provided answers to the following serious questions:
With the inexplicable release of suspect Ali Harzi by Tunisian authorities earlier this month, why are there no suspects in custody?
Secretary Clinton, Secretary Panetta, Attorney General Holder and DNI Clapper still haven't testified before Congress--what steps did they take during the attack and in the days that followed?
What were the President's activities during the seven-hour period of attack?
Why wasn't the U.S. military deployed to assist? On the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in American history, after multiple attacks this year on U.S. and Western interests, why were U.S. military units and assets in the region not ready, alert and positioned to respond? After all, two of the four people were killed seven hours after fighting began.
Why do we still not have clear answers on the internal process that produced the inaccurate talking points on which Ambassador Rice relied several days after the attack?
Why were the testimonies of the U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi on September 12--eyewitnesses who knew there never was a demonstration outside the Consulate--not immediately factored in to the judgments of our intelligence community?
Why wasn't Secretary Clinton interviewed by the Pickering Commission?
Was the White House aware of the FBI investigation of Gen. Petraeus? If not, why not?
There are also serious questions about links of this terrorist attack to the protests at the U.S. embassies in Cairo, Egypt, Tunis, Tunisia and Sanaa, Yemen that same week--where each American compound was breached by individuals allegedly linked to al Qaeda-affiliated groups. What, if any, were the connections between these incidents and the attack in Benghazi?
These questions are too serious--and the consequences too grave--to be brushed aside. There are critical legislative decisions the next Congress will have to make based on the answers of these questions. But more importantly, the American people deserve answers to these questions--including open hearings and an unclassified report.
The select committee I am proposing should draw from the existing congressional investigations by including the chairman and ranking member of each committee of jurisdiction--Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, Judiciary, Armed Services, Homeland Security and Oversight and Government Reform--as well as five additional Republicans appointed by the Speaker and two additional Democrats appointed by the Minority Leader.
I appreciate the support I have received for this resolution from the original cosponsors, as well as the Heritage Foundation. I also submit for the record a recent op-ed that was published on RealClearPolitics.com by former Senator Fred Thompson articulating the benefits of a unified select committee. Senator Thompson has a unique perspective on the need for this committee given his experience as counsel on the Senate select committee on Watergate.
Mr. Speaker, we owe it to the families of the victims, and the American people, to fully investigate this terrorist attack. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
As we fixate on the latest version of Gen. David Petraeus' testimony or the misleading statements of Susan Rice, I suggest that we stop and think about the size of what we are dealing with. The Benghazi tragedy raises questions concerning the protection of our embassies, the performance and capabilities of our military and our intelligence community, as well as the decisions of high-ranking officials in the Department of Defense, the State Department, the White House and possibly the Justice Department. The scope of the questions that involve an array of officials, and sensitive agencies and departments of our government, is unprecedented. The inquiry into what happened and why, along with who is or should be accountable, calls for a focused, responsible effort equal to the seriousness and the complexities the issues. I've seen this rodeo before, both in a constructive manner (Watergate, where I served as a counsel) and a less-than- constructive one (Clinton-era investigations, where I chaired a committee that probed at least one facet of the various scandals). On our present course, the prospects for a relatively short but thorough, credible, bipartisan congressional investigation are not good. The prospects for a disjointed, drawn-out mess, replete with partisan bickering, are much better. It is easy to identify at least eight congressional committees (four in each chamber) with claims of jurisdiction in the Benghazi matter. No committee has jurisdiction over all of it, and several committees have jurisdiction over parts that overlap with the jurisdictions of other committees. Some of the committee hearings will involve classified information and will be conducted behind closed doors. Members of ``Committee A'' will not know what a witness told ``Committee B'' in a closed hearing. Gen. Petraeus' recent appearance on Capitol Hill demonstrates how difficult it can be to get a consistent story when the witness is making multiple appearances before even the same committee. Perhaps not all committees with jurisdiction will have hearings, but if half of them do it will produce competing hearings, with competing staffs and competing press conferences over much of Capitol Hill. It will also take longer than necessary, as government officials shuffle back and forth giving repeat performances. Different committee chairmen and their committees will make different rulings on document production, whether to move for immunity for witnesses who refuse to testify on the basis of the 5th Amendment, and a host of other matters. This is simply not the most efficient and credible way to proceed. And it is less likely to arrive at the truth. The seriousness of the matter calls for something better. It calls for a select committee that is given a specific mandate, a budget and a cut-off date that can be adjusted if it is agreed upon. It needs to be comprised of members of both parties who have been selected by their leadership because of their proven integrity, reputation for fairness, and expertise in a given area. In a matter fraught with political implications, it is especially important that Congress accept its responsibility and minimize partisanship as much as possible. History demonstrates that this goal is much easier to achieve with a handful of selected people than it is with many. Since 1789, when Congress investigated a failed military expedition, select committees have been utilized to serve such important and sensitive functions, and the Benghazi matter should follow in that long tradition, whether by means of a joint committee of both houses of Congress or by either chamber. Most select committees have become historical footnotes. Some, however, are well remembered because of the contribution they made to helping Congress carry out its duties of legislating, overseeing the executive branch and educating the American people as to the operation of their government. Ironically, it is because of the success of these panels that some members of Congress and others oppose the formation of one in this case. They say that forming a select committee for a matter such as Benghazi, where a consulate and four American lives were lost, would attach too much importance to the investigation. They fear that it would be equating it with Watergate. Of course, if the Watergate standard, as they define it, is now the operative standard for the formation of a select committee, then seldom, if ever, will another select committee be formed. Critics of the select committee miss the point on several levels. First of all, if indeed a comparison is to be made, one must look at the seriousness of facts and issues presented concerning Benghazi and compare them with the seriousness of facts and issues presented at the times when other select committees, such as Watergate, were formed. So compare the Watergate burglary with what we have here. Can there be any doubt that Benghazi passes the Watergate test? The wisdom of utilizing a select committee should not just be judged on the outcome of the committee's work; dramatic results are not always achieved or warranted. The select Watergate Committee is a beneficial reference point, not because of the end result of its investigation a year and a half after it was formed, but because of the process Congress utilized to deal with a difficult situation. At that time, we had a Republican president and a Congress controlled by the Democrats. Yet the Senate voted unanimously to form the committee. Democratic leadership appointed Sen. Sam Ervin, reputed to be the chamber's leading constitutional scholar, to chair the committee. The Republican leader appointed Sen. Howard Baker to be the vice chairman and leading member of his party on the committee--a senator who was respected on both sides of the aisle. These men protected the legitimate partisan interests of their respective parties and the path was not always smooth, especially behind closed doors, but they understood that their colleagues, as well as the nation, were depending upon them to be responsible and seek the truth. Authority and accountability were clearly placed on the committee, and its members performed accordingly. Select committees are not perfect creations by any means. A clear narrative is often difficult to produce under any circumstances. However, a select committee is simply much more likely to produce focused and credible results. Soon we will see if the United States Congress is still capable of coming together toward the common goal of getting to the bottom of a very serious matter. Or, are decisions about select committees simply reflective of positions based upon whose ox is in danger of being gored?",VA,WOLF,0.511,R,mr speaker today reintroduc resolut establish hous select

355,FL.GARCIA,FL,Garcia,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend and legend in the Key West community, Fred Cabanas. An aerobatic daredevil, fourth generation Conch, loving husband, and father, Freddy died this past Tuesday doing what he loved, flying.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest sympathies and condolences to all who knew him, especially to his wife of over 30 years, Susan, and his two children, Kelly and Ray.
Freddy began flying at the age of 16, hanging around airport hangars at Key West International Airport, exchanging plane washes for flying lessons. In time, Freddy became an aviation legend in Key West.
Freddy helped put Key West on the map by opening ceremonies and competing in airshows with incredible stunts, both high in the sky and frighteningly close to the ground. His skill and enthusiasm for aviation were so ingrained in Key West culture that he was named General of the Conch Republic Air Force.
But, Freddy was more than a talented aviator. He was a skilled and generous businessman as well. As the proprietor of Cabanas Aeronautics Unlimited, he enjoyed providing sightseeing tours of the beautiful Florida Keys, thrill rides to the brave-hearted, and perhaps most of all, giving back to others, from mentoring other pilots to flying supplies to earthquake-stricken Haiti.
Mr. Speaker, the skies above Key West are just a little dimmer today without Freddy zooming overhead, but he will long be remembered for his renowned talent, gregarious spirit, generous heart, and the indelible mark he has left on the cultural fabric of Key West.",FL,GARCIA,-0.173,D,mr speaker rise today honor dear friend legend key west commun fred cabana aerobat daredevil fourth gener conch love husband father freddi die past tuesday love fli would like take opportun express deepest sympathi condol knew especi wife 30 year susan two children kelli ray freddi began fli age 16 hang around airport hangar key west intern airport exchang plane wash fli lesson time freddi becam aviat legend key west freddi help put key west map open ceremoni compet airshow incred stunt high sky frighteningli close ground skill enthusiasm aviat ingrain key west cultur name gener conch republ air forc freddi talent aviat skill gener businessman well proprietor cabana aeronaut unlimit enjoy provid sightse tour beauti florida key thrill ride braveheart perhap give back other mentor pilot fli suppli earthquakestricken haiti mr speaker sky key west littl dimmer today without freddi zoom overhead long rememb renown talent gregari spirit gener heart indel mark left cultur fabric key west

360,MA.MCGOVERN,MA,McGovern,"Mr. Speaker, 3 years have passed since the Supreme Court's dreadful Citizens United decision, and we have seen the dramatic increase in the amount of corporate money flowing into our elections, drowning out the voices of ordinary American citizens eager to participate in the political process.
Citizens United also epitomizes the so-called ``corporate personhood'' movement in which some now say that corporations are people. The fact is, corporations are not people, and the Constitution was never intended to give corporations the same rights as the American people. Corporations don't breathe, they don't have kids, and they don't die in wars.
My constituents continue to express concern about the growing influence of corporations in our political discourse. They're also demanding action on campaign finance reform because they are repulsed by the large amount of money in our campaigns. Quite frankly, they want elected officials to spend more time on policy, deliberating and debating on issues, and less time dialing for dollars.
Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the House has failed to address these pressing issues during the past 2 years. They have been indifferent. We haven't had the opportunity to vote on any legislation to curb the influence of unlimited and sometimes secret corporate money flowing into our elections. We haven't even had the opportunity to address these issues in committee hearings or markups.
Recently, I joined 18 of my colleagues in a letter to Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers of the Judiciary Committee requesting a hearing to explore constitutional amendment proposals in response to Citizens United and related cases. I hope that we will have an opportunity to discuss these issues in the coming weeks and months. This is, after all, the people's House, and this is the place where we ought to discuss the concerns of the people.
Members of the Democratic Caucus have been working to reform our campaign finance system and restore the rights of the American people that were undermined by the Citizens United decision. We have sponsored and cosponsored legislation to address the growing influence of money in our democratic process.
As a member of the task force on elections reform, I'm proud to join my colleagues in working to rein in corporate spending and address unregulated money flowing into our elections.
Today, I'm introducing two constitutional amendments. The people's rights amendment would overturn Citizens United and put a stop to the growing trend of corporations claiming First Amendment rights. This amendment not only addresses corporate rights as they pertain to campaign finance, but is broader in scope to clarify that corporations are not people with constitutional rights. Importantly, my amendment clearly protects the people's rights of freedom of speech, freedom of press, free exercise of religion, freedom of association, and all other such rights of the people.
My second amendment advances the fundamental principle of political equality for all by empowering Congress and the States with the right to regulate political spending. It will allow Congress to pass campaign finance reform legislation that will withstand constitutional challenges.
Mr. Speaker, we need to empower people, not corporations or Big Money special interests. Our current system has been corrupted. It undermines the rights of ordinary citizens, and it undermines our democracy. Surely, this is not the system our Founders envisioned. The preamble to the Constitution is ``We the people.'' Let us hope that this Congress doesn't forget that.
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting these important bills to reform our campaign finance laws and assure that corporate rights do not trump people's rights.",MA,MCGOVERN,-0.545,D,mr speaker 3 year pass sinc suprem court dread citizen unit decis seen dramat increas amount corpor money flow elect drown voic ordinari american citizen eager particip polit process citizen unit also epitom socal corpor personhood movement say corpor peopl fact corpor peopl constitut never intend give corpor right american peopl corpor dont breath dont kid dont die war constitu continu express concern grow influenc corpor polit discours theyr also demand action campaign financ reform repuls larg amount money campaign quit frankli want elect offici spend time polici deliber debat issu less time dial dollar unfortun republican leadership hous fail address press issu past 2 year indiffer havent opportun vote legisl curb influenc unlimit sometim secret corpor money flow elect havent even opportun address issu committe hear markup recent join 18 colleagu letter chairman goodlatt rank member conyer judiciari committe request hear explor constitut amend propos respons citizen unit relat case hope opportun discuss issu come week month peopl hous place ought discuss concern peopl member democrat caucu work reform campaign financ system restor right american peopl undermin citizen unit decis sponsor cosponsor legisl address grow influenc money democrat process member task forc elect reform im proud join colleagu work rein corpor spend address unregul money flow elect today im introduc two constitut amend peopl right amend would overturn citizen unit put stop grow trend corpor claim first amend right amend address corpor right pertain campaign financ broader scope clarifi corpor peopl constitut right importantli amend clearli protect peopl right freedom speech freedom press free exercis religion freedom associ right peopl second amend advanc fundament principl polit equal empow congress state right regul polit spend allow congress pass campaign financ reform legisl withstand constitut challeng mr speaker need empow peopl corpor big money special interest current system corrupt undermin right ordinari citizen undermin democraci sure system founder envis preambl constitut peopl let us hope congress doesnt forget ask colleagu join support import bill reform campaign financ law assur corpor right trump peopl right
361,VA.GRIFFITH,VA,Griffith,"Mr. Speaker, I rise and submit remarks in honor of Virginia State Trooper Jay Ferland, a devoted public servant, who along with Trooper Philip Battel saved a family of three from a house fire in Saltville, Virginia.
When I first learned of their bravery, news reports failed to mention Trooper Ferland's involvement. On January 2, I spoke of this incident and only mentioned Trooper Battel. However, both men are deserving of our recognition.
To recap, in the early hours of Friday, December 28, 2012, Trooper Ferland and Trooper Battel were in search of a stolen car that had been involved in an earlier police chase when they noticed off in the distance an orange hue. They decided to investigate. When they reached the area in question, much to their surprise, Troopers Ferland and Battel saw a home engulfed in flames. They banged on the door, but when there was no answer, they made the selfless decision to enter the home and investigate.
Their actions in the house awoke its three residents who had no idea that their home was burning down around them, leading to their ultimate escape from the burning house and from the fire. Because of their bravery, the family was saved, and all are in good health. Their lives were saved, and the lives of two of their pets were also saved. The heroic actions of Trooper Ferland and Trooper Battel in service to the community are to be commended, and I am honored to be here today to pay tribute to them.
Please join me in thanking Trooper Jay Ferland and Trooper Philip Battel for all they have done for the people of southwest Virginia. The Virginia State Police, as my experience has shown over the years, always respond in fine fashion and rise to the occasion. Trooper Ferland and Trooper Battel are among just two of the many law enforcement officers to note in the long and proud history of the Virginia State Police.

362,TX.POE,TX,Poe,"Mr. Speaker, in a remote region of Algeria at an oil and gas facility, in the dark of night before the sun rose, workers from all over the world were getting ready to sit down for breakfast when suddenly gun-wielding Islamic radicals stormed the facility.
Some of the workers were killed; some were able to escape; some were taken hostage. One of the hostages killed in this attack was a member of my congressional district, Victor Lovelady.
Victor was a native of southeast Texas. He was originally from Nederland, Texas, a town of primarily hardworking, blue collar folks centered around the energy industry. Victor had recently moved to Atascocita, Texas, his home not far from where I live. He was 57 years of age.
When he died, he was on a contract assignment for ENGlobal, an energy company in Algeria. According to his family, Victor waited to take that contract until his children had finished school so he could attend their sporting events. This was not surprising for someone who was described as a ``dedicated family man and a fantastic coworker.'' Although it was hard to be so far away from his family, Victor was excited to take the contract assignment so he could ensure a secure future for his family. That's just the kind of father and husband he was.
The deal for this contract was 28 days on, 28 days off, and he was just 10 days in with only 18 days left to go. He was scheduled to come home to Texas the day after his daughter's birthday. His life was stolen by those who seek to destroy Americans, the radicals who inflict terror on all who believe in freedom.
Victor is survived by a loving family, including his wife, Maureen; daughter, Erin; and their son, Grant. Over the holidays, the close Lovelady family expressed concern for the safety of Victor, but he reassured them saying, ``It's so safe. We have protection.'' It's hard for people to understand such unspeakable evil.
I spoke with Victor's brother, Mike, throughout the crisis and as did Congressman Randy Weber. Yesterday, after we heard the terrible news, Mike told me:
I can associate with my brother getting in a car wreck or having cancer. But terrorism and Nederland, Texas, don't go together.
He was described as ``a great family man and a fantastic coworker'' and ``a leader who mentored countless individuals during his tenure.'' He was also known for his spontaneous wit. Victor moved from Nederland, Texas, to Atascocita to be closer to work, but he went back and forth so that his children could finish school there.
Mr. Speaker, Victor was killed not just because of what he did; he was killed because of who he was. He was killed because he was an American. A radical Islamic al Qaeda group by the name of the Signatories in Blood claimed responsibility for this terrorist attack, those who seek to destroy us and kill indiscriminately.
They hate us for who we are and what we stand for. Diplomacy is not in their vocabulary.
Two other Americans were also killed in this attack. Their names were Gordon Lee Rowan of Sumpter, Oregon, and Frederick Buttaccio of Katy, Texas.
The Algerian military retook the compound after 3 days, and they found that 34 other hostages had been killed, as well as dozens of terrorists.

363,AL.BROOKS,AL,Brooks,"Mr. Speaker, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen testified before the House Armed Services Committee that America ``is maintaining nearly historic fiscal deficits and national debt. Indeed, I believe that our debt is the greatest threat to our national security. If we as a country do not address our fiscal imbalances in the near term, our national power will erode, and the costs to our ability to maintain and sustain influence could be great.''
Admiral Mullen is right: debt caused sequestration. Debt and sequestration will slash our uniformed personnel to their lowest levels since before World War II; will reduce our Navy to the smallest number of operational vessels since World War I; and will cut our Air Force to the smallest number of operational aircraft in its history. In sum, debt is putting America's national security at risk.
Last week, on January 17, the Comptroller General of the United States delivered to President Obama a Government Accountability Office report on America's financial health. I have reviewed many government audits and financial statements during my three decades in public office. I have never seen warnings as stark as those given by the GAO to President Obama. Some lowlights of the GAO report are striking and deserve emphasis.
In fiscal year 2012, the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, commonly known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, reported about $85 billion in net valuation losses. The Federal Government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $34 billion. The Postal Service ``finished the year with a reported net loss of almost $16 billion.'' The Federal Housing Administration reported that its liabilities exceeded its assets by about $15 billion.
Mr. Speaker, America is on a path to insolvency and bankruptcy, an event that will debilitate our country. America has incurred four consecutive, unsustainable trillion-dollar deficits and is in the midst of a fifth consecutive trillion-dollar deficit. America's national debt exceeds $16 trillion. Interest on our debt is well in excess of $200 billion per year. To put our debt service burden in perspective, that is more than four times what the Federal Government spends on all highway and transportation infrastructure projects in America each year. Unless Washington becomes financially responsible, future debt service will escalate and even more money will be spent on debt service rather than on programs that serve Americans.
America's Comptroller General issued a stern warning to President Obama:
The comprehensive, long-term fiscal projections show that, absent policy changes, the Federal Government continues to face an unsustainable path. Over the long term, the structural imbalance between spending and revenue will lead to the continued growth of debt held by the public as a share of GDP. This means the current structure of the Federal budget is unsustainable.
America's current path and Federal budget are unsustainable. Absent changes, Federal Government insolvency and bankruptcy are certain to result and cause an economic disaster unrivaled in America's history. This week, the House of Representatives faces a vote to increase America's debt ceiling. Pending legislation raises the debt ceiling by roughly $300 to $400 billion. What protection from the risk of insolvency and bankruptcy does America get in return?
Are there any spending cuts? No.
Are there policies that spur economic growth and result in revenue increases? No.
Does this proposal help fix in any way the trillion-dollar deficits that threaten America with financial ruin? No.
Mr. Speaker, I can only speak for me. I will not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless significant efforts are made to fix the underlying problem of deficits and accumulated debt that force debt ceiling votes and risk America's future. I will not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless, first, Congress passes a substantive balanced-budget constitutional amendment that solves the debt problem for future generations or, second, we implement sizable spending cuts that help get our financial affairs in order.
I take this stance full well knowing the adverse economic effects of a failure to raise the debt ceiling but also knowing, Mr. Speaker, that those effects pale in comparison to an insolvency and bankruptcy of the America I love.",AL,BROOKS,0.837,R,mr speaker thenchairman joint chief staff admir michael mullen testifi hous arm servic committe america maintain nearli histor fiscal deficit nation debt inde believ debt greatest threat nation secur countri address fiscal imbal near term nation power erod cost abil maintain sustain influenc could great admir mullen right debt caus sequestr debt sequestr slash uniform personnel lowest level sinc world war ii reduc navi smallest number oper vessel sinc world war cut air forc smallest number oper aircraft histori sum debt put america nation secur risk last week januari 17 comptrol gener unit state deliv presid obama govern account offic report america financi health review mani govern audit financi statement three decad public offic never seen warn stark given gao presid obama lowlight gao report strike deserv emphasi fiscal year 2012 feder nation mortgag associ feder home loan mortgag corpor commonli known fanni mae freddi mac report 85 billion net valuat loss feder govern pension benefit guaranti corpor liabil exceed asset 34 billion postal servic finish year report net loss almost 16 billion feder hous administr report liabil exceed asset 15 billion mr speaker america path insolv bankruptci event debilit countri america incur four consecut unsustain trilliondollar deficit midst fifth consecut trilliondollar deficit america nation debt exce 16 trillion interest debt well excess 200 billion per year put debt servic burden perspect four time feder govern spend highway transport infrastructur project america year unless washington becom financi respons futur debt servic escal even money spent debt servic rather program serv american america comptrol gener issu stern warn presid obama comprehens longterm fiscal project show absent polici chang feder govern continu face unsustain path long term structur imbal spend revenu lead continu growth debt held public share gdp mean current structur feder budget unsustain america current path feder budget unsustain absent chang feder govern insolv bankruptci certain result caus econom disast unriv america histori week hous repres face vote increas america debt ceil pend legisl rais debt ceil roughli 300 400 billion protect risk insolv bankruptci america get return spend cut polici spur econom growth result revenu increas propos help fix way trilliondollar deficit threaten america financi ruin mr speaker speak vote rais debt ceil unless signific effort made fix underli problem deficit accumul debt forc debt ceil vote risk america futur vote rais debt ceil unless first congress pass substant balancedbudget constitut amend solv debt problem futur gener second implement sizabl spend cut help get financi affair order take stanc full well know advers econom effect failur rais debt ceil also know mr speaker effect pale comparison insolv bankruptci america love

369,CA.SWALWELL,CA,Swalwell,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the great work done by the Alameda County Family Justice Center, a nonprofit organization in California's East Bay, which represents my district.
I was an Alameda County prosecutor, and it was during my tenure that the Justice Center was founded by my former boss, Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley. Prior to its existence, people in my area subjected to domestic violence, human trafficking, or sexual assault had to navigate a complicated bureaucracy and go to many different places to obtain much-needed services.
The Justice Center changed that by coordinating and centralizing critical programs in just one place. It operates as a one-place location for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking, offering services like counseling, job training, and housing. Those suffering at the hands of abusers now have a place to rest, recover, and restore their lives.
As a prosecutor, I saw the horrible damage that these crimes cause, and I am grateful that the traumatized victims of the East Bay have the Justice Center to which they can turn.

370,OH.KAPTUR,OH,Kaptur,"Mr. Speaker, yesterday, President Obama struck several important themes. None was strategically more vital than making America energy-independent again. Then he referenced the related challenge of climate change and its impact on life on our continent and world. Only fools would fail to pay attention to the necessity of change to meet the needs of a new era.
Our dependence on importing foreign oil cost America over $321 billion last year, racking up a $140 billion trade deficit in petroleum and energy alone. With that lost income comes lost jobs by the hundreds of thousands. So many more people could be employed here at home, developing domestic energy sources rather than defending exploitation and extraction abroad.
And on climate change, the President recognized the reality of fierce and expensive weather incidents like Hurricane's Sandy and Katrina, or our declining lake levels and river levels, like the Mississippi, or the 2-foot drop in Lake Erie over the last year. We must anticipate and adapt our lives where possible.
Yes, as the 113th Congress begins, our primary aim will be to welcome the challenges of change, not cling to the past.

History shows us that when abortion is illegal, it does not go away; it becomes dangerous. And that's why it's important to continue to make sure that abortion is legal, rare, regulated, and safe.
Before Roe, more than a million women each year took great risk to access health care they needed. They faced unlicensed and ill-equipped physicians, unsanitary conditions, illness, and death. This is why the Supreme Court ruling was so important 40 years ago. It ensured safe, legal abortions for these women.
Roe v. Wade ensures the basic right of privacy, the freedom to control one's body and one's future. It can be easy to feel complacent today, but the threats against reproductive health care rights are increasing.

And this was delivered by Justice Blackmun for the Court.
I reread that decision on this day and was struck by the statement that the task for the Court is to ``resolve the issue by constitutional measurement, free of emotion and of predilection.''
Justice Blackmun went on to quote Justice Holmes in Lochner v. New York, and he said:

Americans should be united that the overspending and reckless financial unpaid loans has created a legacy of debt for all current and future generations of Americans. Americans are united that it is right to help those most needy and vulnerable.
Sadly, the debt prevents this Nation from fully meeting those needs. The annual interest alone is crowding out our ability to fund services for those most in need. National debt annual interest is a part of mandatory spending that consumes 60 percent of our yearly expenses. This crowds out important services and creates economic harm that costs Americans jobs.
It is time to work together to end the debt and provide a secure future for all Americans.

I have spoken with constituents at their doorsteps, and I have had conversations at events throughout our community. The one message central New Yorkers have made clear to me is that we need to grow our middle class, fix our economy, and create more good-paying jobs for the working families of this country. Central New Yorkers want a fair shot at the American Dream.
Now, we need to balance the budget, but we need to do it in the right way, not on the backs of our middle class and seniors. Medicare and Social Security must be protected, but we can do this without sacrificing vital investments in future generations.
Our local businesses want to expand and hire new workers, but they need the young people with the abilities and demeanor to succeed. That's what I have heard going around central New York. We need to keep central New York part of the broad shoulders of the middle class on which this country's future rests.

Before that baby draws his or her first breath, it's greeted with a $50,000 bill, their part of the U.S. debt. Mr. Speaker, that's reckless.
But there's something even more reckless. The only way to solve these problems is with a budget--every house knows it, every business knows it, almost every government knows it, but not the U.S. Senate, which hasn't passed a budget for 4 years.

389,MN.ELLISON,MN,Ellison,"Mr. Speaker, thank you for allotting the time. I appreciate it very much.
My name is Keith Ellison. I'm here today to reflect on what I believe was a historic speech for the ages yesterday. President Obama met the historic challenge, met the historic moment; and I just want to talk about my feelings about how important that speech really, really was. President Obama, you should understand, was called upon to make his second inaugural address. And inaugural addresses, historically, are speeches that people don't always remember, but there are some that we will never forget because of how important they are.
His first speech 4 years ago was a speech during which, over the course of 18 minutes, he talked about trying to reach out diplomatically. He talked about the importance of trying to come together to solve common problems. And I think the basic attitude of the first speech was conciliation in an effort to try to work out problems both foreign and domestic.
In this speech, however, President Obama set forth what I believe was a clear, concise agenda based on values that he owns. I was so proud to hear President Obama talk about the need to address climate change. He reminded us that you can believe in climate change or you can disbelieve in climate change, but the fact is our storms are harder, the drier weather we are seeing is causing forest fires, and we are seeing climatic catastrophes associated with climate change. We're seeing the consequences of it. So if we ignore the cause, we cannot ignore the consequence. I was so proud to hear him say that.
He also spoke out boldly for equality, human rights and civil rights for all Americans. I remember that he said, and you may recall, too, Mr. Speaker, he said, we will never forget Stonewall, Seneca Falls, and Selma. These are three iconic moments in civil rights history when he talked about the women's rights movement, the gay rights movement, and the African American movement for civil rights; but they all added up to one thing, which is that an American is an American is an American. It doesn't matter what your color is, what your sex is, or who you love and want to be with. What matters is that you are an American and entitled to the full protection of the law in these United States.
I think it was very important for him to do so. It represented an evolutionary moment in American history that a President being inaugurated into his second term would stand up for the first time and say ``civil and human rights for all people.'' I thought it was a great moment, and I found myself cheering even though I hadn't planned on doing so.
But he didn't stop there. He specifically said we need to stand here and protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, three critical programs this Nation depends on, three critical programs that seniors depend upon. But not only do seniors depend on them. Also we know that seniors and people live on survivors benefits. When their loved one who gets Social Security dies, children are entitled to get survivors benefits. And these survivors benefits are literally putting food on the tables for millions of families all across this country.
But not only that. People with disabilities get Medicare and Social Security. And he stood up for these programs, reminding us that this richest country in the history of the world--the richest country in the history of the world--does not need to throw its poor, its vulnerable, and its aged under the bus. We are not too broke to make sure that our senior citizens, our children who are on survivors benefits, and people who are vulnerable economically, we're not too poor to make sure that there's something for them and that they have a livelihood and a way to make it forward.
Imagine the richest country in the history of the world saying, I'm sorry, Grandma, but we got to cut your benefits because we can't make it. The reality is that when he gave that speech and he specifically identified those three programs as central to the American Dream, the American promise, I was proud. And I said, that's right. And I tell you, I was so happy to hear him say that.
But he didn't even stop there. He talked about the need for immigration reform and the fact that for so many people around the world, America is still the land of opportunity and that we cannot sit by as 12 million people live in our country in the shadows with no pathway toward citizenship. The President specifically called on us to do something about it.
Now, the President knows that guns are a volatile issue. He didn't smack the issue of gun violence prevention right on the head, but he did mention the victims of Sandy Hook; and he did tell us that children have a right to be safe at school, thereby signaling that, you know, yeah, we are going to do some things about the proliferation of guns, high-capacity clips, and background checks, things that make sense, not taking away the right to own a gun, but to do commonsense gun violence prevention measures that I think will make everybody safer. In fact, if you're looking at the news right now, you know that there was another shooting today in Texas--today--today.
So the bottom line is that the President laid out a vision, an inclusive vision, for America. The President got up in front of the world stage, all the Members of Congress, Ambassadors, Senators, the Supreme Court, and everybody assembled and said, This is the direction that we're going in. We're going to say Americans, whatever their background, are included within the promise of America. We're going to address income inequality. We're going to protect the social safety net.
Now, some pundits--you can always count on the punditry to throw salt around--they said, well, it didn't reach out to the Republicans. Well, I think that Republicans are on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; and they probably, or at least their parents, appreciate protection of that program. Republicans live on this planet in which we see the temperature rising and the consequences of global climate change hurting more and more people. Some Republicans are black, some Republicans are Latino, and some Republicans are gay. And when they heard that they are included in Obama's vision of America, they must have felt good about that.
So I don't agree that this speech didn't reach out to the full range of the political spectrum, left and right. I think that if you're in the category that he mentioned, that no matter what your political ideology may be, that you would feel that, yes, this includes me.
Now, I think the President's speech was also great because it was courageous. No President has ever mentioned before the gay community in the United States; and most people like myself and most people are what we call straight or heterosexual.
But all of us know that there is prejudice against the gay community. There's no denying this. There's no sense in denying it. We all know that these folks are our neighbors, they're our coworkers, they're our friends, and we know that they have suffered because of prejudice against them. For a President to stand up and say this isn't right and that everybody is included in the American Dream, I thought was a great moment. It was a first. It was historic. I think that President Obama seized the historical mantle and said, I'm not going to sit up here and use a bunch of flowery, vague language. I'm going to get up here and talk about what I really believe in. I was so proud of Obama yesterday. I admired how he handled himself and what he said.
I think over the past 4 years, President Obama has, in my opinion, bent over backwards to reach out to the Republican Conference. He has really accommodated them in a whole number of ways, and yet their conference--and the record is clear--has come forward and said that their goal over the course of the last 4 years was to make him a one-term President. Well, they failed. He's a two-term President. So the question is: Are we now going to come together? Is the caucus of ``no'' now going to say there are some things we're willing to work with? I hope so.
Let me tell you. My dad was a Republican for many years. Of course, I love my dad and loved him when he was a Republican. He was what I would call a ``sensible Republican.'' He believed in watching the money. He believed in getting the most out of every dollar. He believed that the government had a limited role and shouldn't get in everyone's business. Today, we have folks who are not in the realm of even negotiation. They're willing to shut the government down, allow our country to go over the fiscal cliff and default on America's debt just to get their way. That's an extremist position. This is an extremist ideology. It's not a reasonable thing to say.
Now, some of them will come up here and talk about how big the debt and the deficit is. Wait a minute. When we say that we want to cut oil subsidies to Big Oil companies, they don't want to do that. When we want to raise some taxes on the wealthy so we can use that money to lower the deficit, they don't want to do that. I doubt anyone who says they're outraged by the debt and the deficit, and we give credible solutions on how to lower it and they say ``no''--I begin to doubt that that's really what they're concerned about.
The speech yesterday that the President gave, I believe, is a good starting point. The President is not negotiating with himself. He's declaring his position. The other side in the political divide can declare their position, and then we can come together and negotiate. I'm a huge supporter of the President, but I kind of believe that what he used to do, he used to state his values, then he used to anticipate what the other side would want, then he used to try to come together, bring both sides together, and then he would go to the table and negotiate. So we would end up not with a liberal position, but with sort of a centrist position, and we would start out right there, and then anywhere we would go from there would be further to the right. So if we're lucky, we end up with a center-right position.
Now I think we start with, as we are proud to be the progressive liberals that we are, we start out with what we believe in, then they say what they believe in, and then we negotiate, and maybe we'll end up in the middle. But I don't want to end up in the center right anymore. I want to end up with some reasonable compromise that protects Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; that protects civil rights for all Americans; that addresses this massive income inequality; that addresses climate change; that moves us toward a green economy; that allows people who are immigrants to have a pathway into the respectability of life in American society. The President did not disappoint last night. I believe in those things. Clearly he does, too. And I was so proud to see the President stand and deliver for these important values.
Over the next several weeks, Mr. Speaker, we're going to be in a huge debate. We just finished the whole debate on the so-called fiscal cliff. It really wasn't a fiscal cliff. That was just the name the press loved to call it, but the reality is it was a set of budgetary deadlines and tax deadlines. We were able to come up with a deal, but the worst part of the deal is what wasn't in it. That's why I voted for it. I wasn't thrilled with the deal, but the thing I didn't like about it was the stuff mostly that was not included. Because even though I was happy to extend unemployment for a year, that was good. Even though I was happy to raise taxes on the richest Americans, because I believe it's their patriotic duty to help their country out, that was good too. I believe those were good things.
I thought the fact that we did not deal with the debt ceiling, the sequester, and the continuing resolution really just put us in a position where a few months later our Republican friends would say: You're going to cut vital programs for Americans who need them, or we're going to shut down the government. You're going to cut Head Start, you're going to cut food stamps, you're going to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, or we're going to default on America's debt. This is the hardcore bargaining position they've been trying to ram down our throat.
I'll never forget Speaker Boehner, who said, ``Look, if they don't take these cuts in one loaf, we'll feed it to them a slice at a time.'' That's a quote.
And so I was concerned that this deal we just did, this so-called fiscal cliff deal, the New Year's Eve deal, even though there were things in it that I thought were good, I was concerned, Mr. Speaker, because of what wasn't in it. I believe the American people and our markets, our business people, deserve to have this budgetary issue resolved in a way so they can actually plan.
My Republican friends correctly point out that there is uncertainty when Congress doesn't solve problems, but they're the ones causing the uncertainty. In fact, they are guilty of creating the problem that they criticize the most. They say that we shouldn't kick the can down the road. They say we should have some finality. But they're the ones who are not agreeing to some finality. They say that we need to make sure that we get some real job creation, but they're the ones cutting into the public sector, causing us layoffs from the Federal Government, and therefore State governments. And of course, people who have government jobs spend money too, which leads people who they do business with to have jobs. If you work for the EPA and you go to a local grocery store, you spend money there, which allows the cashiers and the stock people to have jobs.
Everything they say they don't want it seems like that's what they're for. They don't want job cuts, they don't want job losses, but they create them. They don't want uncertainty, but they create it. They want finality, but they avoid it. It doesn't make any sense. They say they want to reduce the deficit, but they enlarge it. So my point is: What's really going on here?
I think President Obama has just kind of had enough and has said rather than trying to figure out how to do a deal with these folks who keep moving the goalpost, I'm just going to say what I'm about, I'm going to declare what my values are, and they can come to the table and represent their own point of view, and we'll find a way, hopefully, to get to a point where we can agree and go forward. Even if we hate the deal, even if we don't like it, at least maybe we can move forward so Americans can at least be able to plan for their future.
Mr. Speaker, I think that Presidential inauguration speeches are important. They do lay out an important path. I was reviewing, Mr. Speaker, the inaugural speeches of President Abraham Lincoln. I'm a huge fan of Abraham Lincoln. I wouldn't call myself an expert or scholar of Lincoln, but I'm sort of an amateur reader of everything about Lincoln.
In Lincoln's first speech, he was conciliatory. You will recall, Mr. Speaker, Abraham Lincoln, when he was elected, as soon as he was elected, Southern States began to secede even before he was inaugurated. South Carolina, Mississippi, the other States, they started seceding each before he was inaugurated. As soon as he was elected, some of them said, We are out of here.
So when he came to his inaugural speech, the first one, he was trying to keep the Southern States in and trying to keep the border States from leaving. So he said some things that were so conciliatory, that even the abolitionists of the time thought that he wasn't what they were hoping for. He wasn't really against slavery. He said he was, but they thought that he didn't prove it. They thought he was halting, they thought he was too cautious, and they criticized him for this.
But after the Civil War broke out and so much blood was spilled and so much harm was done to our Nation--620,000 people died in the Civil War--President Lincoln came back 4 years later. On that speech, his second inaugural speech, it was a bold defense of the union cause and an argument that slavery must go.
He didn't pull any punches on the second one. Now, he was not bodacious, and he was not offensive--he was trying to be as conciliatory as he could be--but he made very clear that America was going to be, one, whole and not divided and, two, that it would be slave free. He didn't water it down, as some pundits think that Obama should water his position down. The second time around, after we went through all the big fights, President Lincoln stood firm and spoke firmly and clearly but also in a conciliatory way about what he believed in. I don't know. Maybe there were some people back in 1865 who might have said, Well, Lincoln ought to be a little more sympathetic to the South, and he ought to try to work with them more.
Look, I'm not trying to compare this budgetary fight to the horror of slavery. There is no comparison, not at all. I'm not trying to say that our Republican colleagues are in any way sympathetic to slavery. They're not. That's not true. I'm simply trying to make the point that when you start out trying to work with somebody and you can't get anywhere, and when you go through all the travails and difficulties of trying to get somewhere and you can't, then at the end of the fight, if you win, you're probably going to say, Look, I tried to work with you and you wouldn't work with me. I ended up coming out on top on this thing, so now I'm going to bargain for my position.
This is not to say the President is not going to negotiate. This is not to say the Democrats aren't going to negotiate. We are going to negotiate. We believe that the democratic process requires an eye toward compromise, but I also believe that we went to our constituents in 435 districts around this country and that we told them what we believed in and we told them what we stood for, so they deserve for us to at least articulate that position. If we have to make a compromise on some things for the sake of the Union, for the sake of the Nation, we should do that, but we should never act like we don't believe in what we do, in fact, believe in, which is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid; which is confronting income inequality; which is equality for all Americans regardless of race, color, sexual preference; and all that kind of stuff. We should say what we believe in. We should say that we believe that a woman should earn every penny that a man makes. We should say these things. We should not be afraid to be who we are and articulate our vision of the world. Then when we go to the negotiating table, there might be some things we have to give up, and there might be some things we get, but we should never make any mistake about what we're all about.
So I'm really proud of the President tonight. I feel the President did a fine job for America yesterday, and I wish the President well. I do know that the President, in being a man of reason, will listen to Republican arguments as to what they would like to see happen, but I also believe, based on what he said yesterday, that he is going to fight for what he believes in, too. He warned us against dogmatism, and he also said Look, don't confuse absolutism with principle. So that's sort of a warning to our side a little bit in his saying, look, I am going to have to negotiate some things. But when he sits around that table, we know where he's starting from, and that makes me feel good.
I wish all the best for this Presidency and this Congress because I think that, if the Republicans are successful and if the Democrats are successful and if the President is successful, then America will be successful. So I'm here to say that I hope we do negotiate, but there are some things that, quite frankly, I'm not willing to cave in on--Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare beneficiary cuts. They're asking for cuts from the people who have already been cut.
Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that 20 percent of widowed women on Social Security have nothing but Social Security to live on, and yet we want to reduce their benefits? Do you know that a full third of widowed women on Social Security depend upon Social Security to the degree of 90 percent of their incomes? We're talking about people who are making somewhere between $17,000 and $24,000 a year to begin with. You cannot go to people who already have so little and say give me back even more.
This is at a time, because of our housing foreclosure crisis, when rents in nearly every city have gone up, and this is at a time when we have limited vitally important programs that help ease the pain of poverty for Americans. So there are some things that we are going to protect in this and that we are going to call upon the masses of Americans to protect.
Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, that today I don't have the ability to be here for the whole hour--duty calls--but I did want to offer a few reflections on the speech that was given. I also want to say a few other things as it relates to the next period coming up.
In the next few weeks, we're going to face a debt ceiling increase. In fact, we have a debt ceiling vote tomorrow. We're not voting to raise the debt ceiling; we're voting to suspend it. I think this is bad policy because markets, businesspeople, and everybody else need to know that the Congress is going to stand by the credit rating and the debts of the American people. We're not going to default, and we shouldn't threaten that we are. It's bad. It's not a good thing to do. It's important for the American people to know that, when we talk about raising the debt ceiling, Congress is not approving new spending. We're not borrowing. We're saying that we're going to pay the bills on debts we already acquired.
It's kind of like this: If you have a family and if somehow you're already obligated to pay a mortgage, if you don't have the money for your mortgage, you may have to go to your cousin or your brother or your uncle and say, I need you to help me until next week so I can pay the mortgage. So you now have borrowed money to pay an obligation that you already owe, an obligation that, if you don't pay, you will default on. You can also have a situation in which somebody doesn't have enough money but goes into a local electronics store and says, I'm going to buy that big screen television right there on my credit card.
Those are two different scenarios--borrowing to meet obligations you've already acquired and borrowing to buy stuff you really cannot afford. Raising the debt ceiling is the first one, Mr. Speaker. It's borrowing to meet obligations we already have. It's not borrowing for new expenditures. So, when we appropriate money and when we have had appropriated expenditures in the past, we might raise the debt ceiling to meet those obligations, which we should do, because to do otherwise is to say that America is going to default on its debts, which we cannot do, not just for our own sakes, but this would cause international harm to the world economy.
People are confused about this whole debt ceiling debate, and I don't believe that it's right for Republicans to just suspend the debt ceiling and then to put a bunch of stuff in there about the Senate and all that kind of stuff, some provisions that are blatantly unconstitutional, too, by the way. So I'm disappointed in this thing that's coming up, but people need to know that this debt ceiling vote is coming up.
They should also know that the sequester is coming up. With the New Year's Eve deal, we delayed the sequester 2 months. These are massive cuts to the tune of, I think, around $89 billion that are going to be put on the Pentagon and domestic spending. They're dumb cuts. We're not looking at specific programs and evaluating their worth and eliminating some and keeping others. We're just, like, ``chop.'' This is no way to budget for a Nation, and I hope we can delay the sequester, but it's coming up soon. Republicans have vowed that they want even more cuts, maybe even in addition to the sequester, to negotiate. I think we should remind everybody that we've already had $1.7 trillion in cuts and that we just did $600 billion in new revenue. That's about $2.3 trillion. How much more cutting do we need to do, particularly when we're talking about vital programs for Americans?
So, Mr. Speaker, if we're going to make cuts, we should cut things that we really don't need. For example, Medicare part D, which passed in 2003, prohibits Medicare from negotiating drug prices with the pharmaceutical companies. Now, the Veterans Administration does negotiate for drug prices all the time, but Medicare is prohibited from doing so. Basically, if the pharmaceutical company says this drug costs this, the government has to pay, and we can't use our large buying power to lower a price.
We should change that. We should introduce competitive bidding. That would save us a quite a bit of money, Mr. Speaker. That's a way we could save money.
Here's another thing we should do. We should eliminate oil subsidies, coal subsidies, and natural gas subsidies. The fossil fuel industry, a highly profitable industry, making a lot of money, a profitable industry, there's no reason in a free market economy we should be subsidizing a profitable company. It doesn't make sense. Even if you are a free market person, you have a hard case to make that we should be handing Exxon, Chevron, and Mobil money. We shouldn't do it. We should end it, and any real conservative would agree with me on that. Now, if somebody is just trying to get money to friends, that's another story. But if you're really about reducing the deficit, that's one way to do it.
You know, there are a number of things we could cut. There's a lot of Cold War weapons systems that could be eliminated. Our nuclear arsenal could be reduced without threatening our national security, and we could save money in doing it.
There are ways to reduce the budget. There are ways to do it, and we probably should. But let's do it in a way where we keep Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, aid for college students, money for investing in medical research, and groundbreaking research to give life to brand-new industries. You know, a lot of people don't know, Mr. Speaker, this thing we call the Internet was started with a government program--something called DARPA. A government grant helped fund the Internet. Yes, it did. I don't know about Al Gore, but I do know that the government, a government grant, put the money into the form that we now know as the Internet. The government did that.
The government funded the project for mapping the human genome. The government. The government's not always bad.
So we should keep some programs. We should lower others, but we've got to think about this thing in a different way than we are.
All I want to say, Mr. Speaker, as I begin to wrap up is that it is an honor and a privilege to be able to serve in this, the greatest deliberative body in the world. And even though we have big fights with our Republican colleagues, it's an honor to serve with them, too. We're both here, sent here by the 435 districts that we represent to argue our positions and try to come to some kind of solution. I believe that we can have solutions if everyone has an eye toward compromise, but that depends upon everybody starting out carrying out the vision of the district they represent.
My district wants me to stand up for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, stand up for civil and equal rights for everybody, including gay people. My district wants me to find a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are here. My district wants me to do something about climate change and move our economy toward a green economy. Now, I'm going to start there, and then we can negotiate with our colleagues on where we end up, but I'm proud that the President stood up for our values. I think his speech was groundbreaking, historic, and gave real energy to people who share his value system.

390,WI.RYAN,WI,Ryan,"Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 503 of H. Con. Res. 112, the House-passed budget resolution for fiscal year 2013, deemed to be in force by H. Res. 5, I hereby submit for printing in the Congressional Record revisions to the budget allocations and aggregates. The revision reflects the budgetary impact of H.R. 8, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which makes permanent certain tax policies enacted in 2001, 2003, and 2010 and would provide relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax. A corresponding table is attached.
This revision represents an adjustment pursuant to sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended (Budget Act). For the purposes of the Budget Act, these revised aggregates and allocations are to be considered as aggregates and allocations included in the budget resolution, pursuant to section 101 of H. Con. Res 112. Sincerely, Paul Ryan, Chairman, House Budget Committee.
allocations and aggregates shall apply while the measure is under
consideration and take effect upon enactment of that measure. The
current aggregates reflect the original budget resolution levels
adjusted only for those measures, which were provided an adjustment
during consideration and that have been enacted into law. Presently,
the revenue aggregates in H. Con. Res. 112 have been adjusted by -
203,799 for FY2013 and by -$3,515,231 for FY2013-FY2022 for measures
enacted into law.\2\ Not applicable because annual appropriations acts for fiscal years

401,NV.REID,NV,Reid,"Mr. President, today, with the inspiration of the second inauguration of President Obama fresh in our minds, we renew our efforts to fulfill the promise of prosperity for every American.
The theme of yesterday's inauguration was ``Faith in America's Future.'' Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose birth and life we also celebrated Monday, once said, ``Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase.'' I have faith that the Members of the 113th Congress will bring this Nation closer to realizing the promise of prosperity. The last Congress was too often characterized by sharp political divides--divides that hampered efforts to foster success for all Americans. I am hopeful and cautiously optimistic that the 113th Congress will be characterized not by our divisions but by our renewed commitment to cooperation and compromise. I urge every woman and every man fortunate enough to serve in this Chamber to remember that it is possible to hold fast to our principles while making the compromises necessary to move our country forward.
Democrats will hold fast to the guiding principle that a strong middle class--and an opportunity for every American to enter that middle class--is the key to this Nation's success. Democrats will stand strong--strong for the standard of balance. We will remain resolute--resolute in the pursuit of fairness for all Americans, regardless of where they were born or the color of their skin, regardless of the size of their bank accounts, regardless of their religion or sexual orientation.
Those principles will direct our course as we introduce our first 10 bills today--a tradition we have had in the Senate, which is that the majority party introduces the first 10 bills--as we mend our broken immigration system, strengthen our schools, and rebuild our roads and bridges, and we will look to those principles as we bring forth other measures included in those 10 bills. Those principles will be foremost in our minds as we balance the right to bear arms with the right for every child to grow up safe from gun violence. Those principles will be our North Star as we work to end wasteful tax loopholes and balance thoughtful spending reductions with revenue from the wealthiest among us. And those principles will point the way as we work to ensure that this country's uniformed servicemembers never struggle to find employment when their military duties end. Through every struggle and every triumph, those principles must be our guide.
Not a single piece of important legislation can pass the Senate or become law without the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, so we will be willing to compromise and work with our colleagues across the aisle. Unfortunately, a number of bipartisan bills passed the Senate during the last Congress that were never acted upon by the House of Representatives. So this year the Senate will revisit some of those legislative priorities that passed on a bipartisan basis here.
We will again take up the Violence Against Women Act. This is an important piece of legislation that is expiring. We will take up the farm bill, which is a revolutionary piece of legislation that would save the country up to $24 billion. We will again revisit historical reforms to save the U.S. Postal Service, and we will take up legislation to make whole victims of Hurricane Sandy. Each of these initiatives passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis after deliberation and debate during the last Congress but was left to languish by the House.
The Senate will continue to help our fellow Americans recover from Hurricane Sandy before another similar disaster strikes. Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed in New York, New Jersey, and New England, and tens of thousands of Americans were left homeless by this destructive storm. We have a responsibility to aid our countrymen as they rebuild their lives and their communities, as we have after terrible floods, fires, and storms in other parts of our Nation.
Once we complete that vital legislation, the Senate will take action to make this institution we all love--the U.S. Senate--work more effectively. We will consider changes to the Senate rules. Because this matter warrants additional debate, today we will follow the precedents set in 2005 and again in 2011. We will reserve the right of all Senators to propose changes to the Senate rules, and we will explicitly not acquiesce in the carrying over of all the rules from the last Congress. It is my intention that the Senate will recess today rather than adjourn to continue the same legislative day and allow this important rules discussion to continue later this month. I am hopeful and cautiously optimistic that the Republican leader and I will reach an agreement that allows the Senate to operate more effectively in the coming months.",NV,REID,-0.428,D,mr presid today inspir second inaugur presid obama fresh mind renew effort fulfil promis prosper everi american theme yesterday inaugur faith america futur dr martin luther king jr whose birth life also celebr monday said faith take first step even dont see whole staircas faith member 113th congress bring nation closer realiz promis prosper last congress often character sharp polit dividesdivid hamper effort foster success american hope cautious optimist 113th congress character divis renew commit cooper compromis urg everi woman everi man fortun enough serv chamber rememb possibl hold fast principl make compromis necessari move countri forward democrat hold fast guid principl strong middl classand opportun everi american enter middl classi key nation success democrat stand strongstrong standard balanc remain resoluteresolut pursuit fair american regardless born color skin regardless size bank account regardless religion sexual orient principl direct cours introduc first 10 bill todaya tradit senat major parti introduc first 10 billsa mend broken immigr system strengthen school rebuild road bridg look principl bring forth measur includ 10 bill principl foremost mind balanc right bear arm right everi child grow safe gun violenc principl north star work end wast tax loophol balanc thought spend reduct revenu wealthiest among us principl point way work ensur countri uniform servicememb never struggl find employ militari duti end everi struggl everi triumph principl must guid singl piec import legisl pass senat becom law without vote democrat republican will compromis work colleagu across aisl unfortun number bipartisan bill pass senat last congress never act upon hous repres year senat revisit legisl prioriti pass bipartisan basi take violenc women act import piec legisl expir take farm bill revolutionari piec legisl would save countri 24 billion revisit histor reform save u postal servic take legisl make whole victim hurrican sandi initi pass senat bipartisan basi deliber debat last congress left languish hous senat continu help fellow american recov hurrican sandi anoth similar disast strike hundr thousand home busi destroy new york new jersey new england ten thousand american left homeless destruct storm respons aid countrymen rebuild live commun terribl flood fire storm part nation complet vital legisl senat take action make institut loveth u senatework effect consid chang senat rule matter warrant addit debat today follow preced set 2005 2011 reserv right senat propos chang senat rule explicitli acquiesc carri rule last congress intent senat recess today rather adjourn continu legisl day allow import rule discuss continu later month hope cautious optimist republican leader reach agreement allow senat oper effect come month
402,KY.MCCONNELL,KY,McConnell,"Mr. President, I wish to start by congratulating President Obama on his inauguration. Presidential inaugurations are always a time for the country to come together. We all feel a certain pride in the event, and we are reminded of how fortunate we are to live in a Nation where we have the ability to choose our leaders freely and resolve our differences in peace. Inauguration Day is also a time for new beginnings, a chance to learn from the mistakes and missed opportunities of the past as we reengage in some vitally important debates about our future.
Too often over the past 4 years, political considerations have trumped the need to put our country on a sound financial footing and a path to prosperity. Today we should recommit ourselves to the task of facing up to our problems head-on. I understand that the passions of an election can sometimes overshadow the business of governing, but the Presidential campaign is now behind us, and so it is my hope that the President will finally be willing to do what Republicans have been asking him to do since his first inauguration 4 years ago, and that is to work with us on identifying durable solutions to the problems we can only solve together, to put aside those things we know we can't agree on and focus on what we can.
We should start with spending and debt because if we don't get a handle on that, nothing else matters. If we don't work together to strengthen our entitlement programs, they will go bankrupt. Automatic cuts will be forced on seniors already receiving benefits, rendering worthless the promises they have built their retirements around. It is nice to say, as the President did yesterday, that these programs free us to take the risks that make our country great, but if we don't act to strengthen and protect them now, in a few years they simply won't be there in their current form. And if we don't work together to control the debt, then the cost of our interest payments alone will eventually crowd out funding for things we all agree on--from defense, to infrastructure, and assistance for those who need it most. In short, the debate we are now engaged in over the growing Federal debt is about much more than numbers on a page; it is about the cost of inaction in terms of promises broken, jobs lost, and dreams deferred. That is why there is simply no more time to waste.
Over the past 4 years, while the President focused on reelection and too many Senate Democrats focused on avoiding tough decisions, the debt grew by more than $6 trillion. We saw the President blast House Republicans for doing their job and passing a budget while Senate Democrats didn't even propose one. Rather than work with us to save existing entitlements, we saw the President team up with Democrats in Congress to force through a brandnew entitlement that will make it even harder to cover the cost of programs we already have. In short, Democrats have put off the hard stuff until now, and our problems have only gotten worse.
But that was the first term. A second term presents the opportunity to do things differently, and in the Senate that means a return to regular order. Later this week the House plans to send the Senate a bill to address the debt limit in a timely manner. Once we get it, the Senate should quickly respond. If the Senate version is different from the one the House sends over, send it to conference. That is how things are supposed to work around here. We used to call it legislating.
I know a lot of Democrats are afraid of a process that exposes their priorities, particularly on spending and debt. After nearly 4 years of refusing to pass a budget, they have only now reluctantly agreed to develop a spending plan for the coming fiscal year. All I would say to that is since the revenue question has been settled, I am sure the American people are eager to see what other ideas Democrats might have to bring down our ruinous deficits.
Let me just say that one thing Americans will no longer tolerate is an attitude that says we can put off our work until the very last minute. They are tired of eleventh-hour deals. They are tired of careening from crisis to crisis, and so am I.
The good news is that a return to regular order is the surest way to solve the problems we face. And I hope some of my friends on the other side will agree that there is value in this body actually functioning the way it was intended to. Let's face it. The status quo isn't working. The Senate isn't functioning as it should. It has nothing to do with the process that has served us well for a very long time. But if we work together and strive to avoid some of the bad habits that have developed around here, I truly believe we will be able to achieve the kinds of solutions that have eluded us for the past 4 years and deliver some positive results for the people who sent us here, with time to spare.
We can do better. I know my constituents expect better than what they have been getting from Congress in recent years, and so should we.

403,IN.COATS,IN,Coats,"Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the minority leader, and I think he essentially gets to the point all of us, in this first week for the 113th Congress, need to be focused on and need to address. This is our first workweek back after the inauguration festivities of yesterday, and I think it is an appropriate time for the Members of this body to discuss the challenges that lay before us over the next 2 years.
The most critical and, in my opinion, the most pressing of these challenges is one we have been dealing with for the past 2 years and is now of even more critical importance, and that is the out-of-control government spending that weakens the health of our economy, threatens the security of our country, and jeopardizes opportunities for future generations.
When I arrived here 2 years ago, it was clear the American people were concerned about out-of-control Federal spending. At the beginning of the President's term 4 years ago, the debt limit stood at $10.626 trillion plus. In the 4 years of that term, it has risen to over $16.400 trillion--nearly a $6 trillion increase.
It is unprecedented in the history of our country to have such out-of-control spending. It has resulted in our borrowing a very substantial amount of each year's budget, which is not healthy whether you are a family or you are a business or you are a State government or you are the Federal Government. The chickens will come home to roost if we continue to do that.
Each American's share of our national debt now is well over $50,000. That means every new baby born in this country instantly owes the government more than $50,000.
We have had 4 straight years of trillion-dollar deficits without a budget in this body. The minority leader just talked about that. Hopefully, we will finally have a budget to work off of and a budget for which we can look at what the priorities are and make tough decisions about how we spend taxpayers' money.
We currently spend over $40,000 a second. These are not partisan numbers, and this should not be a partisan issue. These are the facts. As our former Governor in Indiana, Mitch Daniels, said: Just do the arithmetic. This is not a deep philosophical or ideological issue. It is a matter of basic math.
With financial problems as great as these, it is my hope as we return now to this 113th Congress we will be able to address this fiscal crisis. It is the same hope I had 2 years ago when I joined the 112th Congress. As we know, we went through a series of efforts to begin to address this problem. Many of those were on a bipartisan basis--we had the Gang of 6 and then we had the supercommittee of 12. These were bipartisan efforts. Many of us worked with our colleagues across the aisle to try to put a grand bargain together. Of course, the President had his own commission led by Mr. Bowles and former Senator Simpson. He rejected that. The Simpson Bowles proposal would have been a good blueprint upon which to begin our discussions. I will be talking some more about that and the disappointment--the extreme disappointment--of Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson in terms of the inability of this body to address what has been predicted as the most predictable financial crisis in our Nation's history.
We went through this whole process of the fiscal cliff. We, unfortunately, had to pick the lesser of two evils in order to protect nearly 99 percent of taxpayers from drastic tax increases, starting with the lowest to the highest taxpayer. The fiscal cliff deal may have allowed the President to fulfill his campaign promise to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, but it did little or nothing to address excessive Federal spending.
So the debate now shifts. The President got his taxes. With revenue off the table, the debate shifts to where it needs to be and should have been in the first place; that is, addressing spending reductions.
Just last week Fitch Ratings warned that America's AAA credit rating is at risk if the Congress and the President increase the debt limit but fail to enact a ``credible medium-term deficit reduction plan.'' We can expect to see more headlines like this if we do not come together and take action to deal with our country's debt obligations.
In the coming days and weeks I will be speaking in this Chamber and outlining what I believe are rational steps we need to take to get our fiscal house in order. The easy thing to do, and the way Congress has operated over these past 2 years, is to look at our fiscal situation and say: Well, we have more time; or we can deal with this after the next election. While I thought that was exactly the wrong tactic to take, that is what happened. There were a series of efforts, but each one ended up so-called kicking the can down the road or postponing the day of decision.
This is the day of decision. This is the hour of decision. This is the time when we have to step up now and address our out-of-control spending. We have had that next election. The President has been reelected for 4 years. Members have been reelected. We have this challenge now in front of us. Continuing with the status quo, governing by a crisis, and failing to address our spending problem must be unacceptable.
Mr. President, 2013 is the year. In 2014 we are back in another election. We all know the precious 6 to 9 to 12 months that lay before us is the time--postelection, with the President's reelection and new Members here--this is the time we have to step up and address our debt and deficit problem.
If we do not do so now, most experts who look at this, whether they are liberal or conservative, nonpartisan or partisan, ideological or nonideological, have virtually all come to the conclusion that unless we address this now in 2013, with an election year in 2014, 2015 will be too late.
We have seen what is happening in Europe. We see what is happening in Japan. We see what is happening around the world--a world hungry for America to lead, to address its problem, not by pushing it down the road, not through avoiding tough decisions, but addressing the real issue before us that impacts the future of this country and the future of generations to come.
So now is the time, now is the hour of decision that we have to take to go forward and address this problem. As I said, I will be using this platform and others as a way to address what I believe we need to go forward with, not only looking at the larger picture but also looking at how this government spends way beyond its means, spends money that it does not have, wastes money through bureaucracy and waste and failed efforts, tries to do more than it should or could or is able, and I want to document some of those--everything from the macro to the micro, from the absurd to the bureaucratic to the necessary tough decisions, particularly in regard to our entitlements that have to be addressed in order to preserve and save those programs for not only current beneficiaries but for future beneficiaries.
Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to begin this process, and I think each of us must dedicate ourselves to the challenge that lies before us. That challenge is dealing with our out-of-control fiscal situation, that if not controlled will bring this country down and continue this economic malaise that we are currently in.

405,NM.UDALL,NM,Udall,"Mr. President, I rise today to talk about our efforts to change the Senate rules. As we began the 113th Congress on January 3, Senators Merkley, Harkin, and I submitted a resolution to reform the Standing Rules of the Senate. Thirteen of my colleagues have signed on to cosponsor our resolution.
When we submitted the resolution, we agreed with the majority leader that it would be best to have the debate about reforming our rules after the inauguration. I appreciate his willingness to work with us on this important issue. Although we postponed the debate, we preserved the right of a simple majority of this body to amend the rules in accordance with article 1, section 5 of the Constitution.
Senate Resolution 4, our proposal to reform the rules, is simple, it is limited, and it is fair. Again, we are not ending the filibuster. We preserved the rights of the minority. Here is what we are proposing: an end to the widespread abuse of silent filibusters. Instead, Senators would be required to go to the floor and actually tell the American people why they oppose a bill or nominee in order to maintain a filibuster. Debate on motions to proceed to a bill or to send a bill to conference would be limited to 2 hours. Postcloture debate on a nominee, other than a Justice of the Supreme Court, would be limited to 2 hours rather than the current limit of 30 hours.
These are sensible changes. These are reforms we are willing to live with if we are in the minority, and yet we are warned these simple reforms will transform the very character of the Senate and leave the minority without a voice. These arguments are covers for continued abuse of the rules.
The reforms we propose are modest--some would say too modest--but they would discourage the excessive use of filibusters. The minority still has the right to filibuster, but not the right of one Senator to do so by simply picking up the phone, by simply making an announcement and then going out to dinner or, more likely, out to a fundraiser. I have listened carefully to the arguments by the other side against these changes. Let me say, again, we are not talking about taking away the rights of the minority, we are not talking about abolishing the right of debate or to filibuster, but there must be change. The abuse of the filibuster and other procedural rules has prevented the Senate from doing its job. We are no longer the world's greatest deliberative body. In fact, we barely deliberate at all. This does not honor this institution, and it does not serve the American people.
For most of our history the filibuster was used very sparingly, but in recent years what was rare has become routine; the exception has become the norm. Everything is filibustered, every procedural step of the way, with paralyzing effect. The Senate was meant to cool the process, not send it into a deep freeze.
Since the Democratic majority came into the upper Chamber in 2007, the Senates of the 110th, 111th, and 112th Congresses have the three highest totals of filibusters ever recorded. Lyndon Johnson faced one filibuster during his 6 years as Senate majority leader. In the same span of time Harry Reid has faced over 390. Lyndon Johnson, 1, Harry Reid, 390. Legislation is blocked at every turn. The result is not surprising. The Senate of the 112th Congress passed a record low 2.8 percent of bills introduced. That is a 66-percent decrease from the last Republican majority in 2005-2006, and a 90-percent decrease from the high in 1955-1956. By every measure, the 112th Congress was the most unproductive Congress in our history.
My Republican colleagues have come to the floor and made many impassioned statements in opposition to amending our rules at the beginning of this Congress. They say the rules can only be changed with a two-thirds supermajority, as the current filibuster rule requires. They argue that any attempt to amend the rules by a simple majority is breaking the rules to change the rules. This is simply not true. The supermajority requirement to change Senate rules is in direct conflict with the U.S. Constitution. Article 1, section 5 of the Constitution states:
Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.
When the Framers required a supermajority, they explicitly said so, as they did for expelling a Member. On all other matters, such as determining the Chamber's rules, a majority requirement is clearly implied. There have been three rulings by Vice Presidents, sitting as President of the Senate--where the Presiding Officer is sitting today--who have ruled on the meaning of article 1, section 5.
In 1957, Vice President Nixon ruled that:
The right of a current majority of the Senate at the beginning of a new Congress to adopt its own rules, stemming as it does from the Constitution itself, cannot be restricted or limited by rules adopted by a majority of a previous Congress.
Vice President Rockefeller and Vice President Humphrey made similar rulings at the beginning of later Congresses.
The Constitution is clear, and there is also a longstanding common law principle--upheld in the Supreme Court--that one legislature cannot bind its successors. Many of my Republican colleagues have made the same argument. For example, in 2003 Senator John Cornyn wrote in a Law Review article:
Just as one Congress cannot enact a law that a subsequent Congress could not amend by majority vote, one Senate cannot enact a rule that a subsequent Senate could not amend by majority vote. Such power, after all, would violate the general common law principle that one parliament cannot bind another.
So amending our rules at the beginning of a Congress is not breaking the rules to change the rules, it is reaffirming that the U.S. Constitution is superior to the Senate rules. When there is a conflict between them, we follow the Constitution.
Some of my colleagues may believe that using the Constitution in this way would be harmful to the Senate. But there is an alternative. We do not have to reform the rules with only a majority vote. Each time the filibuster rule has been amended in the past, a bipartisan majority of Senators was prepared to use the constitutional option. But with a majority vote on the reforms looming, enough Members agreed on a compromise and they passed the changes with two-thirds in favor.
We could do that again. I know many of my Republican colleagues agree with me. The Senate is not working. As I visit with my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they tell me they are unhappy with the way things are. I said 2 years ago I would push for the same reforms at the beginning of the next Congress regardless of which party was in the majority.
At the time, many people believed the Democrats would lose their majority. So let me be clear: If Leader McConnell had become the new majority leader in this Congress, I would have asked him to work with me on these same reforms.
I will say again, the proposed changes will reform the abuse of the filibuster. They will not trample the legitimate rights of the minority party. I am willing to live with all the changes we are proposing, whether I am in the majority or the minority.
The other side has suggested a change in the rules is an affront to the American people. But the real affront would be to allow the abuse of the filibuster to continue.
We have to change the way we do business. We have to govern. It is time for us to pay attention to jobs and the economy and what matters to American families--what they talk about around the kitchen table. That was the message that was sent us from this election, and we would do very well to listen to it.
Under the abuse of the current rules, all it takes to filibuster is one Senator picking up the phone. That is it--does not even have to go to the floor and defend it--just a phone call by one Senator: no muss, no fuss, no inconvenience, except for the American public, except for a nation that expects and needs a government that works, a government that actually works together and finds common ground.
Maybe some of my colleagues believe the Senate is working as it should, that everything is fine. We do not take that view. It is not working and it needs change. The American people of all persuasions want a government that actually gets something done. The challenges are too great, the stakes are too high for a government of gridlock to continue.

408,OR.MERKLEY,OR,Merkley,"Madam President, I am rising today to talk about the vision we have ahead for the next 2 years and how this Senate can fulfill its responsibilities under the Constitution to do its legislative responsibilities addressing the big issues facing America.
I don't think anyone is unaware that for the last 2 years this Chamber has seen simply inaction and paralysis. It has been rated as one of the worst 2-year sessions in the history of the U.S. Government.
Well, what are we going to do differently? How is it that we only address 1 out of 24 appropriations bills over the last 2 years? How is it that so many important bills never made it to the floor of the Senate, bills such as the replacement for No Child Left Behind, which was a bipartisan vision that came out of committee.
How is it that so many bills came to this floor to never see a final vote? These are bills, such as the DISCLOSE Act, which would have eliminated secrecy in campaign donations; the DREAM Act, which would have honored creating a future for those who know only America as their home; the President's jobs package, which would have helped put America back to work; and the closing of loopholes for the biggest, most wealthy oil companies. Those funds could be put to use reducing our deficit or funding critical programs for working Americans.
On issue after issue after issue, we saw inaction. What we heard yesterday at the start of this next 2 years was a call from the President for action. In his inaugural speech he said:
For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect. We must act, knowing that today's victories will be only partial.
The President echoed, if you will, the thought that he brought into his first 4 years, the urgency of now. We have big issues facing America, and it is time for the executive branch and the legislative branch to work together to address those issues.
In this call for action, we must ask how much action can there be if we see more than 100 filibusters in the next 2 years? How much action can there be if on every request for a vote an objection is heard that creates a day of delay in this Senate? The contrast is enormous from the time that Lyndon B. Johnson was President of the Senate.
Lyndon B. Johnson, during 6 years of presiding over this body, saw one filibuster. Harry Reid, in his 6 years of presiding over this Senate, has seen 391 filibusters.
Let me convey that even when we have the votes to end a filibuster, the fact that it is launched creates enormous paralysis. Imagine you are debating a bill, and you continue debating through the end of the week. When you come in the following Monday to debate, and nobody has anything left to say, then someone says: I ask unanimous consent that we have a final vote on this bill. Now, you see, we don't have a previous question on this floor, so one has to ask unanimous consent. Any of the 100 Senators can weigh in and say no.
When they weigh in and say no on that Monday, then on Tuesday a petition is put forward with 16 Senators saying: Let's have a vote on closing debate. That vote can't happen until Thursday, under the rules.
If it is successful on a Thursday, we have to have 30 hours more of debate before we can hold the final vote. That takes us into Saturday. Monday through Saturday is lost based on an objection on Monday by one Senator.
If we have 391 of these objections that waste a week of our time in the course of a 6-year period, then we basically waste every legislative week because there are not 391 weeks in a 6-year period.
It becomes pretty simple to see why we only were able to get one appropriations bill done in the last 2 years, and why so many bills never made it to the floor of the Senate for consideration even though they were essential to restoring the economic vitality of our Nation and putting people back to work. I, for one, find this absolutely unacceptable.
Over our history there have been three basic forms of filibusters. The first only worked in an age when transportation didn't work very well, and at any given moment there were a number of Members who couldn't get here to the floor of the Senate because they were traveling from their farms and the axle on their wagon broke or the train broke down or so on and so forth. Sometimes those journeys would take many weeks and things happened along the way. In that situation, a quorum of 50 percent plus 1 was sometimes in doubt, and those seeking delay could say: You know what. Let's deny a quorum.
Well, that was an effective tool only through that period. Then, as that changed, folks said: You know, we have the respect here of hearing everyone out. Therefore, if I can get to the floor of the Senate, I may delay this Senate as long as I am able to speak.
Well, it is through this effort that we have a number of famous filibusters, folks such as Strom Thurmond holding forth for 24 hours. We have, however, seen that a person can only delay the Senate for 24 hours. Then someone else can seek the floor, and you may proceed. So that was a fairly modest strategy.
In both the case of the denying quorum and in the case of speaking as long as you could, you had to spend time and energy. You had to organize, and it was visible before this body. It was visible before the reporters gathered in the balcony. Therefore, the American people, long before there was a television camera here, could see what you were doing, and the public could provide feedback on that.
But now we come to the modern era, from 1970 forward, in which it has become popular to start using the objection as an instrument of party warfare, the objection to a final vote. If we turn back before 1970, we had an overlap between the parties of perhaps 30 Members. So if you had used this objection, you would have a good sense that you would be able to get cloture. Furthermore, there was a social contract that you only interrupted the workings of this body on an issue of deep principle. You only blockaded the operations of the Senate on an issue of profound concern to your State, not as a routine instrument of party politics.
But that has changed over the last 43 years, since 1970 forward, and now the minority party can say: Let's show that the majority can't even get an agenda onto the floor of the Senate, and then let's complain about them not acting. This is not a philosophy that serves America. It is not a philosophy that was embraced through the extent of our history. You came here with the responsibility to contribute in committee, to contribute on the Senate floor, to try to make bills better, and to try to get issues addressed. You were not trying to paralyze this body so issues don't get addressed that may be contained on that side. That, quite frankly, is an unacceptable theme that has started to haunt this Hall, and we need to do something about it.
Indeed, if we look at the modern era where the parties have become so divided, we no longer see that overlap of 30 Senators. Therefore, any minority group, be it the Democrats, be it the Republicans, has the ability to bring this Chamber to a halt. But is it right to do so? If we cannot persuade our colleagues it is wrong to do so, then we need to change the rules of the Senate. We need to insist if someone is going to throw a shoe into the gears, if someone is going to blockade the ability of the Senate to deliberate and decide, then that Senator needs to take responsibility here on the floor of the Senate.
Yes, we should get rid of the filibuster on the motion to proceed. Filibustering on whether to get to a bill does not enhance deliberation on the bill itself. We should make that decision in a crisp fashion and get on to the work, not waste weeks trying to decide if we are going to do the work of the people.
Second, we should get rid of the filibuster on going to a conference committee. Both Chambers have decided. They have voted in favor of the bill. It has been passed in different forms. Nothing should impede getting to conference and having a negotiation. Indeed, out of those negotiations, even if starting with one Chamber having a dramatic view different from the other, there is a coming together that takes steps forward that both Chambers can agree to. So nothing should impede that negotiation from going forward. We recognize a bill can still be filibustered when it comes back from committee, so why impede getting to the conference committee in the first place?
We should greatly reduce the number of hours after we have gotten cloture on debate. On nominations, by the time we vote on closing debate, our Members know how they are going to vote on that nominee. So we could have a final 2 hours but not a final 30 hours. Thirty hours is another wasted set of days we can ill afford. And certainly it makes sense to say, whenever possible, we should cut down that 30 hours on bills after we have reached cloture. We can do it by unanimous consent, and we often do that now. We can do it by requiring Senators to proceed to a vote if they do not stand and talk, but that is postcloture.
Here is the thing: When 41 Senators say they want additional debate, they want to delay the decisionmaking process here in the Senate, they should be willing to stand and make their case before their colleagues and the American people. It takes time and energy if you go that direction. It doesn't become a freebie where one Senator spends no time, no energy, and can go off to dinner or on vacation while paralyzing the Senate. You should have to spend the time and energy to be here to make your case.
Not only is that important in stripping away frivolous filibusters, it also means the American people get to weigh in. I am absolutely convinced if we were to go back to the debate on the DISCLOSE Act, which stripped away secrecy in campaign donations, and we had 59 votes to close debate--we needed a sixtieth--if those who voted for additional debate, and who fled this Chamber fearful of making their case before the American people, had been required to stand and defend secrecy and foreign donations in our campaign system, the American people would not have said they were heroes but they were bums. They would have weighed in and said to their own Senators: Join the effort to close debate, because to stand in the way of a final vote over secrecy in campaign donations does great damage to our democracy. Maybe the pressure and common sense of the citizens would have helped address the bitter partisanship that guides this body.
At a minimum, the citizens of this Nation have the right to know what is happening to legislation here on floor. The idea it is being paralyzed by the secret filibuster is unacceptable, so we should include the talking filibuster in any package we bring to modify the rules of the Senate.
I see my colleague from New Mexico has come to the floor, and he spoke earlier. He has put forward the vision that we must, at the start of every 2 years, evaluate how the Senate is working, and if it has problems we need to pass changes in the rules to address those problems.
This is not some remote concept of inside baseball. This is about American citizens having a legislature that can address the big issues facing our Nation. So I praise him for his leadership in putting this forward, which has led to this day. And it is the second time. We were here 2 years ago making this case, making this argument that we owe it to our citizens to improve the workings of the Senate, and we are here again today.
There is a saying about the Senate, that the Senate is the world's greatest deliberative body. If only it were so. It has been, at various points in its history, a thoughtful Chamber, a deliberative Chamber. But not today. It is driven by deep partisan differences, those being converted into strategies of paralysis, that prevent deliberation. We must change that. It is our responsibility as Senators to change that. The American people expect it. Let's make it so.

410,NM.UDALL,NM,Udall,"Madam President, once again let me say at the beginning it is a real pleasure to see my old attorney general colleague, now the Senator from North Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp, in the chair presiding over the Senate, and also to see the Senator from Maine, Angus King, here--our new Senators. I think Senator Merkley would agree with this, that our new Senators bring an energy to this that we don't necessarily have. We are 4 years from our last campaign. We ran in 2008. I love hearing their stories and what they have heard and how they have visited with people in townhall meetings.
The American people get this. I don't think there is any doubt that they really get this. I know my colleague has done a number of townhalls on this issue. I just hope, as we have the chance to discuss this, both in our caucus and on the floor and with other Senators, that we can capture the energy of the Senators who have arrived here and have been out with the people in their States, with their constituents, and what they bring to this.
But I wanted to ask the Senator because, among many of our Senators, he does regular townhall meetings--and I have also done a number in my career--is this kind of rules change something that is so arcane that people don't understand it? Are they saying: Why are you bothering with procedure or do people get it?

411,OR.MERKLEY,OR,Merkley,"To my colleague from New Mexico, I would say they most adamantly get it. In fact, I had 13 townhall meetings 2 weeks ago, in conservative parts of the State, in more liberal parts of the State. And in every setting--every setting from conservative to liberal--folks said: Please, please continue this effort to address the filibuster and the paralysis, and the simple notion behind the talking filibuster.
If a Senator is voting for more debate--that is to delay the workings of the Senate--then he or she should be making their case on the floor so the citizens get to see what is going on and they get to decide whether they support it or oppose it. That idea resonates with people. It is the way folks think the Senate works, and they often think the rules that required it in the past have been changed so it does not happen now. So it is a chance I have to explain to them that what has changed is the social contract; that when people objected to the Senate proceeding with its business in the past, they wanted to make their views known on the Senate floor. They wanted to take responsibility because they realized it was a very high privilege to be able to delay the Senate and they had a responsibility to do so only for deeply principled or large issues and to make their case known.
So I do see overwhelming support.

412,NM.UDALL,NM,Udall,"The Senator made some nice comments about me--he was probably a little too generous--and I wanted to also thank him for all the work he has done on this issue. He has been a passionate voice for change, and he and I have both reached out to our friends across the aisle and tried to get things done.
I always bring this back to the question of why are we doing this. We are doing this so government can tackle the issues the American people care about. And I think there are two times in history--I am sure there are many others--where for me the Senate was in its glory days. We should always remember we have that potential. We see little bits of light every now and then here, such as with the passage of a transportation bill or a farm bill out of the Senate where bipartisanship exists and we come together, but I wish to talk very briefly about two time periods that I consider to be the glory days of the Senate.
One was before the Civil War. In the 40 years before the Civil War, the Senate was grappling with how do we hold the Union together. There was tremendous discussion, and Senators such as Daniel Webster and John Calhoun and others would work with each other and have heated debate, but for that 40 years before the Civil War, they held the country together. It was the Senate that fashioned those compromises that allowed the country to stay out of the Civil War. They didn't completely prevent it, but most people, looking at history, say those were some of the glory days of the Senate.
The second period was in the 1960s and 1970s, with Senators such as Muskie and Stafford and Chafee--giants in this body--who stepped forward on civil rights, stepped forward on environmental issues, stepped forward on the pressing issues of the time. So the Senate, once again in that time period, passed laws.
I remember; I was a kid here in Washington, and my father was Secretary of the Interior, when the wilderness law, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Environmental Protection Agency was set up. Those were big laws--big, bold laws--that were dealing with our problems. So once again, they are glory days of the Senate.
I think we have that potential. As I see the new Senators coming in, the folks who were elected with us, and the Senators who arrived in the last 5 or 10 years, I think we have the ability to respond in a big, bold way to the crises that face us.
I know Senator Merkley came here as a young man with Senator Hatfield, I believe, and he saw a different Senate. Maybe he could talk about that. We don't want to stay; I know we are going to a caucus and we have our generous chair here--our presiding officer--so we don't want to keep her up here too long.

413,OR.MERKLEY,OR,Merkley,"I think my colleague from New Mexico is absolutely right in pointing out there were periods when the Senate really worked to face the big issues of America. And it wasn't that there weren't profound differences. There were fierce differences, emotional differences, deep differences, but folks came to this floor, they conversed, they laid out their arguments and, ultimately, they made decisions about which way to go. They didn't bring the attitude: Well, let's paralyze this Chamber from doing anything. Had they done that, there would never have been the set of changes that addressed significant issues in either of those periods.
My colleague is right that a part of the reason I feel so strongly about restoring the functioning of this Senate is that when I came here as an intern at age 19 for Senator Hatfield, I had the very good fortune to be assigned to the Tax Reform Act of 1976, and then I had the even better fortune that it came up on the floor of the Senate. So during the many days it came before the body, I sat up in the staff gallery and watched as amendment after amendment was raised and debated and voted on. And since in those days there was no camera or e-mail, the member of the Senate team who was responsible for it would run down from the staff gallery, intercept their Senator, and tell them what the issue was, what was said about it, what the folks back home thought about it, what the set of motions was that had been dealt with on it, and so it was a legislature at work. And rarely, rarely, did the thought that anything would not be decided by 51 pass the minds of Senators. Again, that objection for 51 was reserved for very special, very rare occasions. It might happen once or twice in your career.
I do feel that the conversation we have before us is so important that I thought I would put up this chart. As my colleague can see, this just dramatizes it. It is a picture of Lyndon B. Johnson showing his one filibuster in 6 years, one time that he needed to get a cloture motion to try to shut down debate; otherwise, there was a courtesy that people said what they had to say and then stood aside and took votes. And here we have Harry Reid in his 6 years--it says ``387 and counting.'' It hit 391 before we completed his sixth year. So there is an enormous difference.
The work we are engaged in right now of trying to find a way to have every voice heard and then to be able to proceed to be accountable and transparent before the public is so important.
As the Senator and I have engaged in this conversation, sometimes we have heard criticism from across the aisle saying: You are trying to silence the voice of the minority. Does the Senator see anything in the proposals that we have been advocating that in any way silences the voice of the minority?",OR,MERKLEY,-0.451,D,think colleagu new mexico absolut right point period senat realli work face big issu america wasnt werent profound differ fierc differ emot differ deep differ folk came floor convers laid argument ultim made decis way go didnt bring attitud well let paralyz chamber anyth done would never set chang address signific issu either period colleagu right part reason feel strongli restor function senat came intern age 19 senat hatfield good fortun assign tax reform act 1976 even better fortun came floor senat mani day came bodi sat staff galleri watch amend amend rais debat vote sinc day camera email member senat team respons would run staff galleri intercept senat tell issu said folk back home thought set motion dealt legislatur work rare rare thought anyth would decid 51 pass mind senat object 51 reserv special rare occas might happen twice career feel convers us import thought would put chart colleagu see dramat pictur lyndon b johnson show one filibust 6 year one time need get clotur motion tri shut debat otherwis courtesi peopl said say stood asid took vote harri reid 6 yearsit say 387 count hit 391 complet sixth year enorm differ work engag right tri find way everi voic heard abl proceed account transpar public import senat engag convers sometim heard critic across aisl say tri silenc voic minor senat see anyth propos advoc way silenc voic minor
414,CO.UDALL,CO,Udall,"In looking at this, I do not see anything in the proposals, and I think we, in working on this together, tried to bring a discipline to it that said we want to preserve the best traditions of the Senate, we want the minority to be heard, we want the minority to have amendments, and we want them included in the process. What we don't want is the tyranny of the minority. And the Founders talked about the tyranny of the minority. They talked about the fact that if you allowed a small minority to govern and block the governing of the majority, that was the tyranny of the minority, and they feared that.
So I think that when we consider this and we talk about the filibuster and our institution today, our Senate, where many times the Republican leader has come to the floor and said that it is going to take 60 votes, everything takes 60 votes, that isn't the way the Founders designed it. The Founders actually had very strong language for what they thought of supermajorities.
Everybody remembers their history. The Founders came off the Articles of Confederation. It was a supermajority. It didn't work. It was broken. So they only put into the Constitution in five places supermajorities--things such as expelling a Member and ratifying a treaty--but otherwise it was simple majorities. And when the history is going to be written, it is hard to tell how this happened. But to have a leader of the Senate stand and say that everything takes 60 votes--the Founders never contemplated that. When they adopted rule XXII in 1917, that wasn't what they were trying to do, and the rule has actually been turned on its head.

415,OR.MERKLEY,OR,Merkley,"Madam President, I would like to follow up on the last point Senator Udall of New Mexico made about our Founders.
I have in my hand three of the Federalist Papers, Federalist Papers 22, 75, and 58. These are by Madison and Hamilton, and they explore this issue of the supermajority. It was a very conscious decision that a supermajority was not put into the Constitution for decisions of these Chambers. And the reason why--and they explained it more eloquently--is essentially that if you take the path that the minority thinks is the right path rather than the path the majority thinks is the right path, then over time you make a series of worse decisions. The minority might be right on occasion, but most of the time the viewpoint brought by those representing the greatest number of States in this case or the greatest number of citizens on the House side is the path that makes sense. And they warned about the supermajority as an instrument that would bring paralysis. It is almost as if they could look forward 200 years to this moment and say: Don't do that because you will end up with paralysis.
This is from Federalist Paper No. 22 by Alexander Hamilton. He wrote this in 1787, and he notes in commenting about the issue of a simple majority that ``there is commonly a necessity for action. The public business must, in some way or other, go forward. If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority, respecting the best mode of conducting it, the majority, in order that something may be done, must conform to the views of the minority; and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater, and give a tone to the national proceedings. Hence, tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good.''
Let me read that last set of words about what Hamilton said would happen if you had a supermajority requirement in the Senate: ``tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good.'' I think anyone watching the proceedings of the Senate for the last 2 years would say that Hamilton was right on the mark in that regard. And, of course, he was not alone. There was not a single Federalist Paper written arguing that there should be a supermajority in the Senate or the House because of the experience that had been had previous to forming the strategy embodied in the Constitution.
Let's turn to James Madison. In Federalist 58, James Madison said:
It has been said that more than a majority ought to have been required for a quorum . . .
He goes on to discuss it in various views, and he said:
Lastly, it would facilitate and foster the baneful practice of secessions; a practice which has shown itself even in States where a majority only is required; a practice subversive--
And here is the key language--
a practice subversive of all the principles of order and regular government; a practice which leads more directly to public convulsions, and the ruin of popular governments, than any other which has yet been displayed among us.
He also made the point that we would end up with equitable sacrifices to the general weal--or general good.
So as we turn to our conversations in our respective caucuses and to the dialog here on the floor of the Senate, I ask my colleagues to search your hearts about our responsibility to the citizens of the United States of America to address the big issues facing America, which means that we don't paralyze this body in secret. If my colleagues have points to make, then make them as was done during the periods of great debate on the floor of the Senate: Make them on the floor of the Senate, engage in that debate, and when no more is to be said, when all 100 Senators say: We have had our full input, then let's make a decision.

Over the Christmas holidays most of our Nation was focused on what Congress would do to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. What was largely missing from that conversation was how to address the much greater and more damaging problem, our growing national debt.
I am not exactly sure what the definition of fiscal cliff was. I think it had different meanings to different people. We dealt with a portion of the fiscal cliff, a slight delay in sequestration, and the consequences of the so-called Bush tax cuts expiring on December 31, but the serious problem is our national debt. Last year's budget shortfall reached $1.1 trillion; the fourth straight year of trillion-dollar deficit spending.
This out-of-control government spending has increased our national debt to a record $16 trillion, which is more than the entire U.S. economy produced in goods and services for the entire year of 2012.
Last week Secretary Geithner let Congress know it will reach its borrowing limit as soon as mid-February. President Obama will request that Congress raise the debt ceiling once again. This is the fifth time that President Obama has requested the debt limit be raised to allow the Federal Government to borrow and spend more money.
What is the point of even having a debt limit if Congress simply extends the Treasury's borrowing capacity each time the limit is reached? While some may say it is irresponsible not to raise the debt limit, our Nation finds itself at a point of such indebtedness that it is equally as irresponsible to extend the debt ceiling without significant reductions in Federal spending.
I voted against an increase to the debt limit 2 years ago and intend to vote against another increase unless we substantially change the way government does business by reducing Federal spending.
In addition to it being alleged that it is irresponsible not to raise the debt ceiling, sometimes it is suggested it is not compassionate to not spend money. Where is the compassion in spending money we don't have that is being borrowed and will have to be repaid by future generations of Americans--our kids and grandkids?
Our country is facing enormous fiscal challenges that, if left unchecked, will have a disastrous impact on the future of our Nation. The simple truth is that government is spending more than it is taking in, and this pattern must not, and in fact cannot, continue.
During the last 2 years alone the government has spent more than $7.3 trillion and increased the Nation's debt by more than $3.2 trillion. We didn't get into this situation overnight. It has been years in the making. Our staggering national debt and deficits are the responsibility of many Congresses and Presidents from both political parties who have allowed us to live well beyond our means for far too long. Americans deserve leadership in Washington to confront these fiscal challenges and fight for the future of our Nation. However, to date, our President and our Congress--this Congress--has failed to provide that leadership.
We learned from the New Year's Eve fiscal cliff negotiations that our work to tackle our debt must begin now. It cannot wait until the eleventh hour when the deadline is near and the consequences are preventable. We have all heard the saying that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results. Why should we expect our fiscal situation to change if we keep doing the same thing: raising the debt limit so we can borrow more money and spend more money?
We know what needs to be done. It will just take the political courage to do it. Rather than wait for another last-minute deal that gets rushed through with little input from the American people, it is time we have an open and honest debate.
I think Americans are ready for leadership that involves tough decisions. The President must come to the table with Congress and put courage and common sense before politics, and that means getting serious about our government's finances.
One of the best ways to rein in spending is to set a budget and live by it. No country, business, or family can operate responsibly without a budget. Crafting a budget is one of the basic responsibilities of Congress, but this Senate has not passed a budget in more than 1,300 days.
When a Kansas family meets the max on their credit card, they don't just call the credit card company and ask them to raise their credit limit so they can keep on spending. No. They cut back on spending and change their budget. Washington needs to do the same.
I hope the stories the Senate is going to address a budget are true, and I hope that means the Budget Committee will meet and--in regular order--deal with a budget. I am a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I hope we have the opportunity to do appropriations bills which matter and follow that budget.
We must take serious action to address this fiscal cliff--the real one--of $48 trillion in unfunded obligations. These programs, which represent promises made by the Federal Government to Americans, must be kept. It is not about undoing Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid, it is about making certain they are available, fiscally sound, and that another generation of Americans can receive the benefits.
Another solution, besides the budget, in getting our spending back under control is to consider and adopt many of the bipartisan recommendations put forth by the President's own Deficit Reduction Commission. The cochairs of that Commission have warned that if we fail to take swift and serious action, the United States faces the most predictable economic crisis in history. Yet the President and Senate leadership has ignored these recommendations and continues to spend borrowed money without regard for the consequences.
The President's solution is to raise revenues to balance the budget, but those tax increases--if he got all he asked for--would only cover our spending for a few weeks. The budget the President proposed during the 4 years he has been President raises taxes. Every budget that the President has proposed in the 4 years he has been in office has raised taxes. One would think maybe that means the deficit is going down. But, unfortunately, the budgets proposed by President Obama would raise taxes, raise spending, and increase debt. To me, that suggests increasing taxes is never the solution that results in less spending and less deficits but just increased taxes and more spending.
History shows us that every time money is raised in Washington, DC, more money is spent by Washington, DC. The revenues we need to balance our books are not increases in taxes but revenues coming from a strong and growing economy. To turn our economy around and put people back to work, Congress and the administration should be implementing policies that encourage job creation; rein in burdensome government regulations; replace our convoluted Tax Code with one that is fair, simple, and certain; open foreign markets to American-manufactured goods and agricultural products; and develop a comprehensive energy policy. We are not immune from the laws of economics which face every Nation.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that government spending on health care, entitlements, Social Security, and interest on the national debt will consume 100 percent of the total revenues generated by the Federal Government by the year 2025. That means the money the government spends on national defense, transportation, veterans' health care, and other government programs will have to be borrowed and will drive us even further into debt.
The CBO issued a report last June which warned that unless we work to reduce our debt, we will face the increased probability of a sudden fiscal crisis that would cause investors to lose confidence in the government's ability to manage its budget, and the government would thereby lose its ability to borrow at these affordable rates.
I do not want to experience the day when our creditors decide we are no longer creditworthy and America has to suffer the same consequences as the countries that have ignored their debt crisis. We need to look no further than the current situation of many countries in Europe to see what high levels of national debt will do to a country's economic health.
Last week one of the major credit rating agencies, Fitch, warned that America risks losing its AAA credit rating if Congress and the President fail to agree to a ``credible medium-term deficit reduction plan.'' Fitch's warning is yet another reason we need to work together to put our country on a sustainable path for the future. We need to heed this warning and take steps now to prevent another credit downgrade.
The American people expect the President and Members of Congress to confront our Nation's challenges and not push them off to some future date. They also want their concerns and voices heard. The last-minute deals, the negotiations by a handful of people are very disturbing to me and to many Americans.
Today I am pleased to share a new opportunity which gives Kansans a voice in the debate on how to reduce spending through a new Web site called Fight for our Future. Kansans can access that site from my home page and learn more about the government's true fiscal condition. Not only can they share their thoughts on why we should cut spending, but they can also vote for a debt reduction proposal they think will be most effective. They will be able to add their name to a message that will be sent to the President and congressional leaders to urge us to put politics aside and work to save our country's future.
The debate over government spending is often seen as one that is philosophical or simply partisan bickering. All my life I heard Republicans and Democrats argue about spending, deficits, and taxes. They think that is what goes on in Washington, DC. This time it is different. Our failure to act will have dramatic consequences to the daily lives of Americans. This is about whether an American can find a job, afford to make payments on their homes and cars, and whether their kids will have a bright future.
The debt limit crisis we are facing now did not have to be a crisis. We knew the day would come when we would have to deal with the consequences of living beyond our means. Let's work together to solve this tremendous challenge.

420,OK.INHOFE,OK,Inhofe,"Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.",OK,INHOFE,0.799,R,mr presid ask unanim consent order quorum call rescind
421,OK.INHOFE,OK,Inhofe,"Mr. President, yesterday President Obama made a beautiful speech. I think everyone agrees that he is a very persuasive speaker. Although I didn't agree with anything he said, it was said beautifully.
I want to read one part of his speech because I don't want to get it wrong. He said:
We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations . . . The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition. We must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries. We must claim its promise. That's how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure.
That is a direct quote which came out of the President's speech, and it has a lot of little subliminal things in there that people did not pick up on, but I did.
One is--and they talked about that--we must show the leadership. That is because of all the things they try to do to damage the economy, to destroy the economy, in terms of the cap-and-trade agenda. And all of that are things that other countries are just waiting for us to do. It is not that we are going to provide the leadership, and all of a sudden China is going to say: Hey, they are doing it, so maybe we ought to do it. China, instead, is sitting back hoping that will happen in this country, so they can have all the jobs that are chased away from our manufacturing base.
There are a few sentences the President dedicated to global warming, and the rest of his speech could be labeled as a liberal laundry list. And I think everyone was expecting that.
I was not surprised that the President decided to do this. All during the campaign and during the weeks since the election, the President's extreme environmental base has been very vocal with their frustrations.
A lot of them go back and say: At one time, Mr. President, you had the White House and you had the House and you had the Senate, and yet you did not even try to get this stuff done. They are talking about, of course, the cap-and-trade system. In fact, there is one good reason he did not get it done, and that is because the votes just are not there.
They want the President to immediately regulate hydraulic fracturing, officially reject the permit for the Keystone pipeline, advance the regulatory powers of the EPA to cut CO emissions, use all of his political capital to push a legislative fix to climate change, and to kill America's oil and gas industry.2
That is what was expected of him. And now, since he does not have to run for reelection, you are going to get a lot more than you did before. So that should make them happy. But it is a lot more rhetoric and not a lot more action.
Studies done during the most recent debate--and that would have been the Waxman-Markey bill; that was the cap-and-trade bill just a couple years ago that they had; I think that might have been the last one we had--the estimates--this is interesting--going all the way back to the Kyoto treaty, they said, the cost, if you try to do cap and trade, is going to be between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. Well, that is between $300 billion and $400 billion a year.
I do something in my State of Oklahoma, and I suggest that the Presiding Officer may do this in his State of West Virginia. Every year I get the figures on how many families there are in my State of Oklahoma who file a Federal tax return and actually pay Federal taxes. Then I do the math. The way it works out, if you are talking about $400 billion a year--and I have not had one person argue with that figure that I have been using for over 10 years now--but if you do the math, that means for each person in my State of Oklahoma, it would cost them about $3,000 a year to do it. The interesting part of this is, you do not really accomplish anything by doing it.
This same agenda at the EPA, under authority he is claiming is under the Clean Water Act, has to be something we are going to talk about. And I do not have any hesitation in doing that.
Bills such as the Waxman-Markey bill--and I believe Senator Boxer and several others have had bills--the cost of that being of some $400 billion a year, would affect industries and emitters of CO that emit 25,000 tons of CO or more a year--25,000 tons. That would truly be just the big emitters. However, the effort of this administration--since they cannot get it passed through legislation--is to do it through regulation under the Clean Air Act.22
The Clean Air Act is specific. And the Clean Air Act goes after anyone who emits at least 250 tons of CO. So stop and think about that because it is very difficult to try to evaluate it and determine just how much it would cost. The regulations they have would force these facilities to receive--anyone who is regulated under this--EPA construction permits, rehabilitation permits, monitoring devices, and install unnecessary and costly technology to reduce CO emissions without any corresponding benefits. This would give the EPA a hand in everything.22
The cost of this is so great that it cannot be calculated. Stop and think about this. If the Waxman-Markey bill--or any of the other pieces of legislation that were called cap-and-trade regulations--were passed, that would regulate only those 25,000 tons or more of emissions. However, the Clean Air Act is 250 tons. So 25,000 tons would be $400 billion a year. How much would it be for just 250 tons? That means every university, every school, every hospital would be subject to the regulation. That is something they have been attempting to do for a long time.
I have to say, there are a lot of appointees of President Obama whom I do not like at all. One I do like--and I am sorry she is not staying--is Lisa Jackson. Lisa Jackson was the Director appointed by President Obama to be the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency. I found one thing really curious about her. While she is very liberal philosophically, she does not lie. That is all I can really ask of people.
I can remember in this case, when they finally gave up--this is just 2 years go. They finally gave up and said: We are not going to be able to pass any kind of a bill for cap and trade, but we are going to go to Copenhagen and tell them we are going to do it another way. If we cannot get a bill passed, we will do it through regulation.
To do it through regulation instead of legislation--this is kind of in the weeds--you have to have an endangerment finding. That is what the law says. So Lisa Jackson was before our committee, and I asked her a question. I said: Madam Administrator, tomorrow I am going to leave for Copenhagen to be the one-man truth squad--because everybody has been over there lying to these other countries saying we are going to pass something over here--and I have a feeling that once I leave town, you are going to have an endangerment finding and do this through regulation. I could see her kind of smiling. I said: When you do that, the regulation that you have is going to have to be based on science. That is what the law says. What science are you going to use? Her answer was: Well, we will use mostly the United Nations IPCC.
A lot of people do not realize--I wrote a whole book about this--this thing all started way back 12 years ago, and it was a thing by the United Nations. They formed the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They are the ones who came up with all this stuff. So she said it is going to be on the IPCC.
Well, poetic justice. It could not have been done better if we had planned it, because it was not weeks after that, it was days after that, that what happened? Climategate. All of a sudden, they realized, through some leaked information, that the IPCC had been lying all those years.
I will mention a couple things.
The UK Telegraph said it is the ``worst scientific scandal of our generation.''
Clive Crook of the Financial Times said: ``The stink of intellectual corruption is overpowering.''
IPCC prominent physicist resigns because ``Climategate was a fraud on a scale I have never seen.''
Further, another U.N. scientist bails. U.N. IPCC coordinating author Dr. Phillip Lloyd calls out IPCC ``fraud.'' ``The result is not scientific.''
And the list goes on and on. Just stop and think about it. The UK Telegraph--one of the biggest publications in the UK--saying it is the ``worst scientific scandal of our generation.''
So we now know that was the science they were going to use. I will always be appreciative of Director Jackson for being totally honest in her response.
But we can guess that would be devastating and cripple the Nation and bankrupt our economy. We know what would happen. The contrast here is stark. On one hand, you have the President saying he wants to control carbon for the sake of protecting our economy and, on the other hand, you have the President's EPA embarking on a regulatory crusade that potentially would be devastating to our economy and America.
The President and the EPA have been working for 4 years to build a case to justify the need for Federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing. A minute ago I listed all the things that were in his speech that I think would be devastating to the economy. One is hydraulic fracturing. I will bet you, 5 years ago, if you said hydraulic fracturing, people's eyes would glass over and they would not know what you were talking about. They all know now because hydraulic fracturing is a process that is used to get oil and gas out of tight formations. I know quite a bit about it because it all started in 1949 in my State of Oklahoma.
In 1949, in Duncan, OK, we discovered that you could unlock these reserves using hydraulic fracturing. So it is something that has been used that way for over a million--a million--applications, and the States have been regulating it and doing so quite well. Everyone is satisfied with the way it has been regulated.
There has never been a case--getting back to Lisa Jackson, I asked her a question in one of our committee hearings--and it was live with TV covering it--I said: Can you tell me and can you identify one case in a million--a million applications of hydraulic fracturing--one case where there has been groundwater contamination? She said she could not. So there has never been a confirmed, documented case of groundwater contamination because of hydraulic fracturing.
Because of these facts, the only reason for EPA regulation of hydraulic fracturing is to significantly limit, if not ban, its use. It would kill the domestic oil and gas industry, which I believe, more often than not, that is exactly what they want.
Well, in closing, the President's remarks yesterday were not surprising to me. But it did confirm the fact that this President is not interested in pursuing an agenda that would help the growing segments of the economy, such as the oil and gas industry.
People talk about our reliance upon the Middle East and people who could become our enemies for oil and gas. All we have to do is produce our own, get the political obstacles out of the way, so we can be totally independent.
I wish to mention two things President Obama has said. One, he says that oil and gas production during his administration--his 4 years--has boomed. This is true, but not in the public sector. It has done so because of hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling, and all these technologies that have been very successful and have worked. He has made the statement over and again that: Well, it would not do any good if we opened public lands for production because it would take 10 years before that would affect the supply and the cost of oil and gas.
Well, there is a guy whose name is Harold Hamm. Harold Hamm is arguably the most successful independent oil man in America today. He is from Enid, OK. I called him because I was going to be on a very liberal TV show and knew they were going to ask this question. I called him so I could document an answer. The statement they were going to make was: Well, President Obama has said it would take 10 years for that, for oil to reach the pumps if you opened public lands. How long do you think it would take?
So I called Harold Hamm. I said: Harold, you have to be accurate in responding to this question because I am going to use it on national TV tonight, and I am going to use your name. So I said: If you were to set up your rig in New Mexico and start drilling--you say: Go right now--how long would it take for the first barrel you brought up to reach the pumps? Without hesitating, he said 70 days--not 10 years, 70 days. Then he went on and told me what would happen each day, how long it would take to go through the refining process and reach the pumps.
So that is just one of the things that has been said over and over to make people believe it is true.
Let me mention a couple of things in winding this down.
Richard Lindzen is from MIT. Richard Lindzen is probably the foremost authority. No one has really questioned him in the past. His statement was: Regulating CO is a bureaucrat's dream. If you regulate CO, you regulate life.22
That is exactly what it would be. Everyone would fall into that regulation.
Getting back to why--I do not want people to sit around and worry about it--you are going to hear a lot of talk and the President is going to do all he can under regulations to try to do cap and trade. We found out--it took extensive research--that the President, in his first 4 years, has actually spent $68.4 billion on cap and trade, and that was not authorized.
So he can do a lot of it through regulation, but it is not going to pass. The reason it is not going to pass is, as we have stated, the cost would be extensive. And what would be accomplished--again, going back to when I asked a question of the Administrator of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, in another hearing--I said, if we were to pass any of the regulations, any of the legislation, the Waxman-Markey legislation or any of the rest of them, would this reduce CO emissions worldwide? She said: No, it would not. She said: Because the problem is not here in the United States. The problem is in China, in India, in Mexico, and other places.2
So you can carry that argument even further. If we were to do this in just the United States, if you were one of those who really believes that CO emissions are causing all these problems--which I do not agree with--but if you really believe that, it still would not reduce them. It would actually have the effect of increasing them because as we chase away our manufacturing base--because we cannot generate the electricity to sustain it--where do they go? They go to countries such as China and India and Mexico and other countries where they have little or no emissions regulations.2
So with that, while it sounded real good yesterday in his speech, and I do have a great deal of respect for the President and his persuasive abilities, I want people to realize, those who are out there recognizing that we can become independent in our energy development in this country, that they are not going to be able to pass cap-and-trade any more now than they have failed to do so in the last 10 years.

424,LA.LANDRIEU,LA,Landrieu,"Madam President, I came to the floor this afternoon to speak briefly about Hurricane Sandy and what the Senate and the House could and should be doing to help the survivors of this catastrophic disaster that occurred now over 3 months ago on the northeast coast. We from Louisiana are very familiar, unfortunately, with disasters. We have had quite a number over the past several years. Unfortunately, I have become an expert on disasters. I don't want to be, but I am becoming one as chair of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and as a leader from Louisiana. All of us, whether we are school board members, city council members, mayors, parish officials or Governors from Louisiana, are becoming experts on disasters because we are having a lot of them.
So I came to the floor to say just a few things this afternoon about Hurricane Sandy. First, I wish to begin by saying the people of the Northeast--and they don't need me to tell them this--have a wonderfully strong delegation in the Senate, Senators Schumer, Gillibrand, Menendez, and Lautenberg. Of course, in Maryland--though we don't hear much about Maryland, there were one or two small counties that were terribly affected in Maryland--and Senator Cardin and Senator Mikulski have been, day in and day out, working with me and with many others, of course, trying to fashion a robust and smart response to the disaster on the East Coast.
We want it to be smart because the taxpayers don't want to waste money on things that don't work. Of course, the survivors want it to be smart because they need us to do our best work now. We can't be late and sloppy and bureaucratic. They have churches to rebuild and faith-based organizations to get back up and running. There are schools and libraries and, most importantly, of course, their homes and their businesses. So this is very important work.
It has been difficult because there are many different philosophies about how to tackle this. I have made my positions fairly clear on certain aspects such as offsets, et cetera. But today I wanted to come to the floor to just acknowledge the extraordinary work of the delegation--led in large measure by Senator Schumer--of Members who have been absolutely rolling up their sleeves at every meeting and trying to build bipartisan support, which we have to do in the Senate. The House can sometimes get away with sending things over here with only the Republicans voting for it and no Democrats, but over here we can't get anything done unless it is done with all of us together. It is just a different set of rules in the Senate, so we have had to work very hard.
Senators Schumer and Gillibrand and other Members worked very hard to get together the necessary votes to get that $60 billion out of here a couple weeks ago. The House, of course, unfortunately, stripped away some provisions but, happily--happily--they left some of the best reforms we have been able to think of in the last 4 or 5 years in the bill, and that is what I wish to talk about today.
I am a big believer in sending aid to the people in America who need it. We send a lot of aid overseas, and we will sure send a lot of aid when we rebuild Afghanistan and Iraq, but I am a real big believer in sending aid to our own taxpayers when their homes are flooded or tornadoes have taken out their area or fires have raged out of control or major storms have hit their area. I am a big believer that when people pay taxes all their life--middle-class families as well as the poor and the working poor, as well as the wealthy, who pay a lot of taxes--they deserve their government to respond when they are at a very dark moment. That is what is happening on the east coast, and these constituents and citizens of ours could not get this help. They need it more quickly.
We are moving as fast as we can--not fast enough for this Senator, but hopefully we can get this vote and this bill to the President's desk. I know President Obama will be happy to sign this and is eager to sign it. I wish to also say thank you to President Obama for his strong support of a robust supplemental and to say how proud I am to have worked with his Cabinet, many of whom are involved in this recovery, and particularly the Secretary of HUD, who is probably one of the most able leaders. All the Cabinet members are very able, but the Secretary of HUD is particularly knowledgeable about rebuilding in a more coordinated fashion because he actually got to practice on us down in the gulf coast. We were kind of like the guinea pigs. Hopefully, we have worked out a lot of the problems and we can take all the best practices and lessons learned.
But Shaun Donovan will do a great job leading that effort on the east coast, I have no doubt, with both a very strong Democratic Governor and a very strong Republican Governor--Governor Christie and Governor Cuomo in that area--along with Mayor Bloomberg and Mayor Cory Booker and so many other small-town officials involved in the recovery. They will have a great friend and a knowledgeable and reliable partner in Secretary of HUD Shaun Donovan.
But let me go into just a few things we were able to redesign, thinking that our citizens and our constituents want government to be leaner. They want government, most importantly, to be smarter and more efficient, and I could not agree more. We have tried, at least in the disaster recovery--when the response to Katrina and Rita was such a disaster itself--to reshape some of this and make it better and smarter. So we put some very effective and smartly designed programs into the Sandy supplemental.
I want to begin by thanking my friend and colleague from the State of Mississippi, Senator Cochran, who joined me in introducing the Disaster Recovery Act in 2011 that contained many of these reforms. Our States have endured the same series of disasters and bureaucratic roadblocks to recovery over the past eight years, and we are determined to prevent communities in the northeast from experiencing the same inefficiency and waste. His contributions to the Gulf Coast's recovery and the development of this legislation have been tremendous, and I am grateful for his partnership in this endeavor.
I also wish to thank my House colleagues, particularly Congressman Shuster, Congressman Rahall, Congressman Denham, Delegate Holmes-Norton, Congressman Mica, who is the outgoing chair of the committee over there and was so instrumental in helping to fashion some of this, Congresswoman Slaughter, Congresswoman Lowey, Congressman Alexander and Congressman Richmond. In particular, Cedric Richmond, who is from Louisiana and a dear friend, along with Congressman Alexander, from my home State, were very instrumental in helping their colleagues--one is a Republican, one is a Democrat--kind of understand why it is important to have these reforms stay in the bill, and they were successful. I am very grateful to them for that.
One of the things from the several lists of things that were in this bill--and that I want to put into the Record--I will just go over and highlight briefly.
No. 1, in the Sandy supplemental, it will reauthorize two expired pilot programs from the post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act that allowed FEMA to repair rental units as a cost-effective temporary housing alternative to trailers and mobile homes and to utilize expedited debris removal procedures.
This might not seem very interesting to people, unless you and your family are looking at living in an 8-by-16 or 8-by-24 trailer for the next 6 months. Then you are very interested. In the old days, when Katrina happened, all people were given were trailers and, in some instances, with formaldehyde in them, which made for a lovely and very healthy way to live for 6 months. We don't want to go over the nightmares of what happened after Katrina and Rita, but we decided we had to give our citizens some other options besides trailers. So if something would happen in Massachusetts, Madam President, your Governor and your local officials could come together and maybe be a little bit creative in thinking about some rental repairs, where maybe people could move into some of the blighted properties. That would also help with the blight. Instead of spending $120,000 per trailer, maybe we could do a little investing in some blight reduction and, at the same time, giving people a temporary place to live. So that is smart. I think taxpayers appreciate it when we try to spend their money in a wiser, built-to-last kind of way. That is what the Sandy supplemental allows.
It also allows the State to draw down a portion of its hazard mitigation funds from FEMA in order to leverage mitigation opportunities earlier in the reconstruction process. In the old days, it would take 18 to 36 months for funding to become available, in some instances, to rebuild a school. That is too long. Can you imagine a community going 3 years without even getting their school started?
I realize sometimes it takes a long time to build things, but you don't want to wait 3 years before you start. So the way we do it now, without spending any more money, is just allowing the Federal Government to push out some of the front money to the locals so they can get started on mitigation projects much sooner. So that is a very smart reform that is included.
In addition, we also provide grants on the basis of reliable fixed estimates for rebuilding damaged infrastructure and facilities and expedited removal of storm debris. This approach will be faster, cheaper, and more effective. The Public assistance program as currently designed may be one of the most dysfunctional programs in the entire Federal Government and will not work for this disaster. Under the current approach, initial damage estimates are often incomplete. Projects must be reversioned multiple times. Decisions are often not made in writing. Frequent staff turnover leads to decision reversals. Hundreds of meetings result in incalculable administrative waste. And it can take years for even a small project to be completed. And let me just put this in English.
What this means is in the old days when Katrina hit--and people are not going to believe it when I say this, but it is true, and I will put this in the Record so people can go find it. But in the old days we would have to take measurements and pictures of a tree to determine how wide the branch was because if it was more than 3 inches you got reimbursed, and if it was less than that you didn't. We would have to go take pictures of trees where the debris came down to try to get the paperwork necessary for the reimbursement. Those days are hopefully over with.
We will now do kind of an estimate just like any normal, rational person would do. You know from past storms how much debris is usually there. You could sort of measure that. There are ways--not just subjective but objective, like geospatial modeling, without having to take pictures of limbs on trees and measure them individually--which is a complete waste of time and wholly irrational and, of course, survivors who are standing there without a house are wondering why government officials are going around taking pictures of shrubs. So we need to move past that. Hopefully, we will with some of this legislation.
No. 4 codifies temporary legislative measures that were enacted to facilitate smarter recovery, including third-party arbitration, eliminating penalties on alternate projects, and consolidating facilities into a single project. This was my most important thing, and I would like to take a minute to explain it to everyone.
A while after Katrina, which was a nightmare, I kept wondering why these project worksheets were never getting settled. We would send thousands of these worksheets to the Federal Government and say: This was our library. We estimate it will cost $5 million to rebuild it.
The Federal Government would say: No, we think it is $2.5 million. That is all we owe you.
So I said: I can understand there could be a disagreement. Who resolves it? No one. What do you mean, no one? No one. It just keeps going around and around, and we just keep sending paper back.
I said: Is there any timeline for the resolution? No. I said: Is there any third-party arbitrator? No. So we put in a third-party arbitrator so that if a project is disagreed to by the locals about what was there, what it looked like, how they should rebuild it, we now have a rational way to step in and get a decision, and it is nonnegotiable. You can't appeal it. But it is better than not having a decision. The local governments really support this, and I am happy we could get that done.
In addition--this was one of my favorites--everyone would run around giving press conferences about how we were going to build smarter and stronger and better, et cetera. Except when we looked into the law and actually read the law, it was illegal. If you tried to move a police station like 10 feet to get it out of the way of the river, or the land had sunk and you wanted to move it to higher ground, you would actually be penalized 25 percent because it became an alternate project since it wasn't exactly the same. So I said: We don't want to build the exact same thing. That was the problem to begin with. Some of our buildings were in places they shouldn't have been. Some of our buildings were built with materials we should never have used. So why are we having to rebuild the same old thing?
Well, that was because that was what the law said. I said: Well, the law needs to be changed, and we are changing it.
So I hope people, while they fuss at government--and I know we have a lot to do to get things straight--know a lot of thought has gone into some of these reforms, and they are based on real-life experiences on what communities have gone through. Hopefully, the Northeast will benefit from this as we go forward.
Let me just put a few more things in the Record. No. 5 allows families to use FEMA individual assistance for childcare expenses.
Here is another thing we found. We do depend on individual citizens to rebuild their communities. Trust me. The Federal Government may send a lot of money, but they didn't gut houses. Do you know who gutted houses? The churches helped, the volunteers helped, and seniors. Many veterans who had fought the war in the ``greatest generation,'' they, at 80 years old, put on gloves and overalls and gutted their own houses.
I mean take your house down to the studs. It is a hard thing to do. Not only is it physically hard, it is emotionally devastating. The Federal Government did not come in and gut people's houses. We had to gut our houses by ourselves.
After we sorted our debris by EPA requirements and dragged it out to the sidewalk and made sure it didn't touch a part of the lawn--because if it did, they couldn't pick it up because they can't go on private property to pick up debris. It is a nightmare. But this is going to be alleviated because parents and grandparents need to get back to gut their homes. They have to have a place for their kids to go that is safe. You can't have children running around in dangerous places. So people aren't thinking about this in a recovery, but schools have to be up and running, and you really should be able to use some of this money for daycare so the parents can work. Some of them quit their jobs to rebuild their homes. They lived off their savings and they went back to work. It is a tough situation.
But I am happy, and I want to thank Mark Shriver, Save the Children, and the National Commission on Children and Disasters who led this initiative trying to help us focus on the storms of the future, what we could do better to help children to make sure their needs are cared for. We think about adults, but, of course, most of these families have kids, sometimes young children. So we have done a little bit. I wish we could have done more, but we negotiated the best we could, and at least we got the childcare provision in.
It reduces bureaucratic waste by eliminating duplicative agency reviews for the same project and the same set of laws governing environmental, historic preservation, and benefit-cost requirements. It also helps the environment by incentivizing recycling of debris. So if we can find a way to recycle it, then people get paid a little bit more as opposed to just throwing it in the landfills. We think that will be a good opportunity to try to promote some good technologies for recycling. And--this is very important--it also corrects a gap in current law that prohibited tribal governments from requesting Federal assistance. They were completely prohibited under the former law. Really, as a matter of fair policy and the Federal law, tribes should be able to request some assistance as well, and that was corrected in this piece of legislation.
It also, finally, eliminates a perverse incentive in the law to use high-priced contract labor for emergency work instead of local government employees, such as firefighters and police officers, which should save the Federal Government millions of dollars.
In closing, I want to thank all of the different organizations that helped to pass this: the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the National Association of County Organizations, International Association of Emergency Managers, International Association of Firefighters, International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the Association of State Floodplain Managers.
This is not a subject that is always fun to talk about because when you are talking about it, it is a lot of suffering that is going on, whether it is Joplin, MO, or Gulfport, MS, or New Orleans, LA, or New York, NY, or the boardwalk in New Jersey. And many of those not-so-small beach communities are very highly populated. There is a lot of suffering. But it is important for us to try, when we can, when we see that the response is not what it should be, to take the time to push out some reforms, to fix what we can fix so that the $60 billion that I hope we will send to them can be used smartly, quickly, and efficiently.
I am living proof of a Senator who has had to literally help lead the rebuilding of the gulf coast, along with my friends from Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. My hometown is New Orleans. My brother is now the mayor, and he is rebuilding that city every day. Eighty percent of the residential communities on the east bank were destroyed completely. That would be like 80 percent of the District of Columbia but not Anacostia, but 80 percent--which would be the whole other side of DC on this side of the river--being uninhabitable. It is hard for people to get their head around that scale. I think Massachusetts has experienced some of these storms. But the scale and scope of the loss is just hard to get your head around. Even though it is not on the 5 o'clock news or the 6 o'clock news or 10 o'clock news or now 24-hour news, it is still happening. So this money and these reforms are important.
So I hope the Senate will act quickly this week. We may have to take up a few amendments from the minority. We have already had the debate about offsets, and we have decided that in the middle of the battle we don't have to argue about who is going to pay for the bullets. We need to go ahead and send the money, and we will figure out how to pay for it later. We are going to pay for it. It is not a question of whether it is going to be repaid. It will be paid for. We should not be arguing about that while the water is rising or while people are gutting their homes or worshiping in tents along the beach. They need their churches back, they need their communities back, and we need to send them money and the smarter tools to help them with the recovery.
So I again thank so many colleagues for helping with this, particularly Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins, who led a lot of these efforts through their leadership of the Homeland Security Committee and spent a significant amount of time along with their staff reviewing and helping to improve this legislation, as well as my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee on Homeland Security.",LA,LANDRIEU,-0.246,D,madam presid came floor afternoon speak briefli hurrican sandi senat hous could help survivor catastroph disast occur 3 month ago northeast coast louisiana familiar

426,NJ.LAUTENBERG,NJ,Lautenberg,"Mr. President, I deeply miss my friend Danny Inouye.
Danny Inouye's passing leaves a huge void in the Senate and for me personally, as I have lost a dear friend, and now being the sole U.S. Senator to have served in World War II is a lonesome post--especially after losing the presence of a Medal of Honor winner.
Danny was not only a great Senator for his constituents, but also the most popular among his Senate colleagues. He exemplified what it means to serve and represented the very best qualities of our country. Whether in the Army or as Hawaii's representative in Washington since the State's birth, he worked tirelessly to do right by every Hawaiian and every American.
Danny volunteered to serve in the Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which was almost entirely made up of Nisei, or people of Japanese descent born in the United States. Although its members faced discrimination at home and many of their families were in internment camps, the 442nd is widely acknowledged as the most decorated infantry unit in the history of the U.S. Army. All of us who served admired the courage and heroism Danny displayed on the battlefield especially in San Terenzo, Italy when 4 days before the war's end, he lost his arm in battle, earning a Purple Heart.
When Danny first joined the Senate in 1962, World War II veterans were common in our chamber and, over the past five decades, the Senators who served in World War II have shared a bond that overcame partisan politics. But I am now the last of that group and I will continue to look to Danny's example to bring colleagues together to do what is right for all Americans.
Danny and I partnered together time and time again on the Appropriations Committee to write legislation that has made America safer and healthier for our families. I will always be especially thankful for his help in crafting relief bills for New Jersey in our times of need after Hurricane Irene and Superstorm Sandy. In fact, his last piece of legislation in the Senate was one to provide relief to those affected by Sandy. 
But perhaps Danny's defining quality was this--in a time and profession that increasingly rewards grandstanding and grasping for the spotlight, Danny served with intelligence, grace and humility. And while he was always a humble and quiet leader, when Danny spoke other Senators listened closely and took his words to heart.

427,PA.CASEY,PA,Casey,"Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in remembering our friend and colleague Senator Daniel Inouye. Dan Inouye dedicated his life to Hawaii and represented Hawaii from when it achieved statehood until his death.
Senator Inouye was respected and loved by members of both parties and both chambers. He was the last Senator to serve with both Everett Dirksen and Richard Russell. Senator Inouye learned early the importance of doing something for the good of the Nation and the good of the Senate, as well as the importance of personal relationships and trust among colleagues. For Dan Inouye, his word was his bond and that applied to Democrats and Republicans alike. He became the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Senate President Pro-Tempore, was the second longest serving Senator in history and served on special committees investigating the Watergate and Iran Contra scandals. At the time of his death, he had long become a Senate giant in his own right.
Long before reaching the Senate, Dan Inouye was an American hero. Enlisting in the Army after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, he served in Europe earning a Bronze Star, Purple Heart and Distinguished Service Cross for helping his fellow soldiers while suffering terrible injuries. Later in life, President Clinton would confer upon him the Medal of Honor.
His moral character and life experiences made Senator Inouye a leader on many of the pressing issues of the day from civil rights to veterans benefits and from health care to helping people with disabilities. Through his position on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye was able to direct funding to important projects and research that helped bring about important advancements as well as simply help people.
Dan Inouye was also a strong supporter of Israel and the Jewish community. From his advocacy on behalf of Holocaust survivors, to his efforts to help free Jews from the former Soviet Union to his influential role in securing funding for Israel, Senator Inouye was a tireless friend and advocate. He was given the nickname ``Trumpeldor'' after a Zionist hero, Joseph Trumpeldor.
In closing, I am reminded of a quote used to eulogize Daniel Webster that President Nixon used when eulogizing Everett Dirksen, ``Our great men are the common property of the country.'' Senator Inouye was indeed a great man and our country is better off today for his commitment, his conscience and his years of dedicated service.",PA,CASEY,-0.362,D,mr presid proud join colleagu rememb friend colleagu senat daniel inouy dan inouy dedic life hawaii repres hawaii achiev statehood death senat inouy respect love member parti chamber last senat serv everett dirksen richard russel senat inouy learn earli import someth good nation good senat well import person relationship trust among colleagu dan inouy word bond appli democrat republican alik becam chairman appropri committe senat presid protempor second longest serv senat histori serv special committe investig waterg iran contra scandal time death long becom senat giant right long reach senat dan inouy american hero enlist armi bomb pearl harbor serv europ earn bronz star purpl heart distinguish servic cross help fellow soldier suffer terribl injuri later life presid clinton would confer upon medal honor moral charact life experi made senat inouy leader mani press issu day civil right veteran benefit health care help peopl disabl posit appropri committe senat inouy abl direct fund import project research help bring import advanc well simpli help peopl dan inouy also strong support israel jewish commun advocaci behalf holocaust survivor effort help free jew former soviet union influenti role secur fund israel senat inouy tireless friend advoc given nicknam trumpeldor zionist hero joseph trumpeldor close remind quot use eulog daniel webster presid nixon use eulog everett dirksen great men common properti countri senat inouy inde great man countri better today commit conscienc year dedic servic

441,VT.LEAHY,VT,Leahy,"Mr. President, I am pleased to once again join with Senator Grassley and today introduce the Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act. This legislation, which is identical to our legislation from last Congress, will provide important protections to employees who come forward and disclose to law enforcement price fixing and other criminal antitrust behavior that harm consumers. This legislation is a continuation of the long partnership that I have had with Senator Grassley on whistleblower issues.
Congress should encourage employees with information about criminal antitrust activity, such as price fixing, to report that information by offering meaningful protection to those who blow the whistle rather than leaving them vulnerable to reprisals. Throughout our history, whistleblowers have been instrumental in alerting the public, Congress, and law enforcement to wrongdoing in a variety of areas. These individuals take risks in stepping forward, and many times their actions result in important reforms and have even saved lives.
The legislation we are introducing today is based on recommendations from the Government Accountability Office, which interviewed key stakeholders in the antitrust community and found widespread support for anti-retaliatory protection in criminal antitrust cases. The provisions in this bill are modeled on the whistleblower protections that Senator Grassley and I authored as part of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, and are narrowly tailored to ensure that whistleblowers are not provided with an economic incentive to bring forth false claims.
The antitrust laws protect consumers and serve to promote our free enterprise system. Our bipartisan bill will help to ensure that criminal violations of these laws do not go unreported. I urge the Senate to act quickly to pass this important legislation.

442,VT.LEAHY,VT,Leahy,"Mr. President, on the first day for bill introductions this year I once again join with Senator Crapo and a distinguished, bipartisan group of Senators to introduce the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013. This life-saving legislation should be a top priority of the new 113th Congress. It is our hope that the Senate will act quickly to pass this strong, bipartisan bill to help all victims of domestic and sexual violence.
The Senate acted just 9 months ago to approve the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2012 with 68 bipartisan votes. Despite our best efforts, the House did not join in our bipartisan efforts and enact that bill into law.
By now, the litany of VAWA's successes is familiar, but important. Since this historic legislation first passed in 1994, States have strengthened criminal rape statutes, and every State has made stalking a crime. The annual incidence of domestic violence has dropped more than 50 percent. We have helped to provide victims with critical services like housing and legal protection. Those are just a few highlights. We need to remember that behind those numbers are thousands of lives made immeasurably better.
Despite VAWA's success, there is a pressing need to update and strengthen its protections. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found that one in four women has been the victim of severe physical domestic violence and one in five women has been raped in her lifetime. These numbers are almost too awful to contemplate.
Real life cases remind us that this reauthorization is long overdue. Last month, I read in the Burlington Free Press the story of Carmen Tarleton, a woman from Thetford, VT. Five years ago, Carmen's estranged husband broke into her home, beat her with a baseball bat, and poured industrial-strength lye on her, severely burning a great deal of her body and nearly blinding her. Her doctors said that she had suffered ``the most horrific injury a human being could suffer.'' Today, she is nearly blind, disfigured, and continues to experience pain from her injuries. Despite this, Carmen is courageously sharing her story.
Stories like this one remind us that every day that we do not pass legislation that will help to prevent horrific violence and assist victims, more people are suffering. Late last year while Congress failed to act on our bipartisan bill, we saw tragic domestic violence-related murder-suicides in Missouri and Colorado. We also learned of harrowing new accounts of sexual assaults on college campuses. These are just more examples of the kind of tragedies that unfold every day across the country.
The Leahy-Crapo bill would support the use of techniques proven to help identify high-risk cases and prevent domestic violence homicides. It would increase VAWA's focus on sexual assault and push colleges to strengthen their efforts to protect students from domestic and sexual violence.
This reauthorization will allow us to make real progress in addressing the horrifying epidemic of domestic violence in tribal communities, where one recent study found that almost three in five native women have been assaulted by their spouses or intimate partners. It will allow services to get to those in the LGBT community who have had trouble accessing services in the past.
Every VAWA reauthorization Congress has passed has taken steps to help immigrant victims of violence, who are often particularly vulnerable. Last year's bill included a modest increase in the number of U visas available to immigrant victims who help law enforcement, which is good for victims and for law enforcement. Unfortunately, that provision led to a technical objection from House Republican leaders. In the interest of making quick and decisive progress, we introduce the bill today without that provision in order to remove any excuse for House inaction. We have retained other important improvements for immigrant victims in the bill we introduce today as part of our commitment to ensuring that all victims are protected.
I still believe strongly in the U visa increase that was in last year's Leahy-Crapo bill. I authored that provision after hearing from law enforcement and the experts in the field. I think it is needed to encourage assistance to law enforcement and to protect immigrant women and I remain committed to enacting it and ensuring that the needed U visa increase is adopted. I intend to work to include it in comprehensive immigration reform legislation that we should consider early in this Congress. It will be part of our immigration reform effort.
We have included, as well, in this year's bill the specific provisions of the SAFER bill that I worked out with Senator Cornyn and Senator Grassley last year and that then passed the Senate unanimously late in the session. I hope that Senators who opposed VAWA last year while supporting those provisions will now join with us in our effort to enact VAWA reauthorization that includes those provisions, as well.
All of the provisions in our bill were developed with the help of victims and with those who assist them every day. They are common sense measures that will help real people. It is past time for Congress to move beyond partisan politics in order to provide help to victims of domestic and sexual violence.
We can make these concrete and important changes in the law that will prevent terrible violence and provide more help to victims. There is no excuse for delay. I hope all Senators will join me in quickly moving this bill through the Senate and that the House will quickly work with us to get a strong VAWA bill to the President.
I thank Senator Crapo, the lead Senate Republican cosponsor of our bill and Senators Murkowski, Mikulski, Ayotte, Collins, Coons, Durbin, Bennet, Klobuchar, Shaheen, Kirk, Cantwell, Murray, Udall (CO), Casey, and McCaskill, who join us as original cosponsors and have all been strong supporters of VAWA. I look forward to many others joining us to move forward on this vital legislation.

444,VT.LEAHY,VT,Leahy,"Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation directed at combating the practice of straw purchasing and illegal trafficking in firearms. I thank the law enforcement partners who have contributed ideas and Senator Durbin for joining me in this effort. I hope that as Senators become familiar with the proposal, they will see it as a focused approach to provide law enforcement officials with the tools they need to go after those who engage in the illegal trafficking. This commonsense measure deserves the bipartisan support that will be critical to any effort in the Senate to reduce gun violence in America.
I have heard again and again from Senators on both sides of the aisle that keeping guns away from those who should not have them is a goal worth pursuing. This bill will further that effort. When the President spoke last week about the need for legislative action in the wake of the horrific events at Sandy Hook Elementary School, strengthening our law enforcement efforts against illegal gun trafficking was one of the key issues he proposed. This bill will answer that call to action.
Next week, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold the first hearing of the 113th Congress on the issue of gun violence. I expect that part of that discussion will include examining various legislative proposals Senators have put forward. We need to move beyond platitudes and toward solutions. It is my hope that as the Committee proceeds we can find areas of common ground.
There is now broad recognition that the Second Amendment guarantees the individual right to own a firearm, and that self protection is an essential part of that right. To the extent there used to be a backdrop of uncertainty about the meaning of the Second Amendment, that time is past. I have long believed that the right to bear arms for protection is a fundamental right. The Supreme Court has now confirmed the individual right guaranteed by the Second Amendment. That is no longer questioned. So we can proceed now in this discussion with certainty that Americans' constitutional rights will be preserved while we seek solutions to prevent gun violence.
There is broad agreement that keeping guns away from those suffering from mental illness and criminals is the right thing to do. I am a responsible gun owner. I know that other responsible gun owners will support better enforcement of the laws that exist to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. We cannot allow those who are barred from buying guns to circumvent our laws. That is just common sense.
Law enforcement officials have complained for years that they lack the legal tools necessary to effectively combat illegal firearms trafficking. Congressional inquiry during the last Congress should have put a spotlight on the very difficult legal environment within which law enforcement officials currently operate. In fact, one of the whistleblowers who testified about the misguided tactics used by Federal law enforcement in firearms trafficking investigations in Arizona described the current laws as ``toothless''. If we are to address gun violence, we must respond to this clear vulnerability.
The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act will make important changes to Federal firearms statutes to give law enforcement officials the tools they need to investigate and prosecute the all-too-common practice of straw purchasing and illegal trafficking of firearms. This practice typically involves a person who is not prohibited by Federal law purchasing a firearm on behalf of a prohibited person, or at the direction of a drug trafficking or other criminal organization. It is a problem that must be addressed. It not only results in the support of larger criminal organizations, but also in the proliferation of illegal firearms and gun violence in our communities. It puts both law enforcement officials and law abiding firearms dealers in a very difficult position but more importantly, this makes our citizens and communities less safe.
Under current law, there is no specific statute that makes it illegal to act as a straw purchaser of firearms. Nor is there a law directly on point to address the illegal trafficking of firearms. As a result, prosecutors must cobble together charges against a straw purchaser using so-called ``paperwork'' violations such as lying on a Federal form. These laws are imperfect, and do not give prosecutors the leverage needed to encourage straw buyers, often the lowest rungs on a ladder in a criminal enterprise, to provide the information needed for investigators and prosecutors to go after those directing and profiting from such activity.
The bill I introduce today will add a new provision to our Federal criminal code to specifically prohibit serving as a straw purchaser of firearms, and establishes tough penalties for those who purchase firearms for, on behalf of, or with the intent to transfer the firearms to someone prohibited from making that purchase directly. Under current law, it is a crime to transfer a firearm to another with the knowledge that the firearm will be used in criminal activity. This bill would strengthen this existing law by prohibiting such a transfer where the transferor has ``reasonable cause to believe'' that the firearm will be used in relation to criminal activity. The bill does contain important exemptions from the prohibition, namely, the transfer of a firearm as a gift, or in relation to a legitimate raffle, auction or contest.
This bill will complement existing law that makes it a crime to smuggle firearms into the United States by specifically prohibiting the smuggling of firearms out of the United States.
The provisions laid out in this legislation are focused, commonsense remedies to the very real problem of firearms trafficking and straw purchasing. The bill does not affect Federal firearms licensees, and in no way alters their rights and responsibilities as sellers of a lawful commodity.
As the Senate seeks a way forward to find national solutions to reduce gun violence, I hope Senators from across the political spectrum can work together to find common ground. We have a responsibility and a duty to refine our laws consistent with the rights guaranteed by the Second Amendment. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, a Senator, a Vermonter, an American, a father and a grandfather, I am prepared to hear all ideas, listen to all views, and work with Senators from both sides of the aisle. The bill I introduce today is the first of several proposals I expect to support to reduce gun violence. I look forward to discussing it further with fellow Senators and witnesses at the upcoming hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.",VT,LEAHY,-0.439,D,mr presid today introduc legisl direct combat practic straw purchas illeg traffick firearm thank law enforc partner contribut idea senat durbin join effort hope senat becom familiar propos see focus approach provid law enforc offici tool need go engag illeg traffick commonsens measur deserv bipartisan support critic effort senat reduc gun violenc america heard senat side aisl keep gun away goal worth pursu bill effort presid spoke last week need legisl action wake horrif event sandi hook elementari school strengthen law enforc effort illeg gun traffick one key issu propos bill answer call action next week senat judiciari committe hold first hear 113th congress issu gun violenc expect part discuss includ examin variou legisl propos senat put forward need move beyond platitud toward solut hope committe proce find area common ground broad recognit second amend guarante individu right firearm self protect essenti part right extent use backdrop uncertainti mean second amend time past long believ right bear arm protect fundament right suprem court confirm individu right guarante second amend longer question proceed discuss certainti american constitut right preserv seek solut prevent gun violenc broad agreement keep gun away suffer mental ill crimin right thing respons gun owner know respons gun owner support better enforc law exist keep gun hand crimin mental ill cannot allow bar buy gun circumv law common sens law enforc offici complain year lack legal tool necessari effect combat illeg firearm traffick congression inquiri last congress put spotlight difficult legal environ within law enforc offici current oper fact one whistleblow testifi misguid tactic use feder law enforc firearm traffick investig arizona describ current law toothless address gun violenc must respond clear vulner stop illeg traffick firearm act make import chang feder firearm statut give law enforc offici tool need investig prosecut alltoocommon practic straw purchas illeg traffick firearm practic typic involv person prohibit feder law purchas firearm behalf prohibit person direct drug traffick crimin organ problem must address result support larger crimin organ also prolifer illeg firearm gun violenc commun put law enforc offici law abid firearm dealer difficult posit importantli make citizen commun less safe current law specif statut make illeg act straw purchas firearm law directli point address illeg traffick firearm result prosecutor must cobbl togeth charg straw purchas use socal paperwork violat lie feder form law imperfect give prosecutor leverag need encourag straw buyer often lowest rung ladder crimin enterpris provid inform need investig prosecutor go direct profit activ bill introduc today add new provis feder crimin code specif prohibit serv straw purchas firearm establish tough penalti purchas firearm behalf intent transfer firearm someon prohibit make purchas directli current law crime transfer firearm anoth knowledg firearm use crimin activ bill would strengthen exist law prohibit transfer transferor reason caus believ firearm use relat crimin activ bill contain import exempt prohibit name transfer firearm gift relat legitim raffl auction contest bill complement exist law make crime smuggl firearm unit state specif prohibit smuggl firearm unit state provis laid legisl focus commonsens remedi real problem firearm traffick straw purchas bill affect feder firearm license way alter right respons seller law commod senat seek way forward find nation solut reduc gun violenc hope senat across polit spectrum work togeth find common ground respons duti refin law consist right guarante second amend chairman judiciari committe senat vermont american father grandfath prepar hear idea listen view work senat side aisl bill introduc today first sever propos expect support reduc gun violenc look forward discuss fellow senat wit upcom hear senat judiciari committe
446,WI.DUFFY,WI,Duffy,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th Anniversary of the Amsoil World Championship Snowmobile Derby on Sunday, January 20, 2013, in Eagle River, Wisconsin.
Fifty years ago, the sport of snowmobiling had just begun. Today, the sport has a national economic impact of $24 billion with an additional international economic impact of $13 billion. Over 100,000 full-time jobs in North America are generated by the snowmobile industry. These American jobs include jobs in manufacturing, sales, and tourism-related services.
I am proud to have a snowmobile manufacturer with facilities located in Wisconsin's Seventh Congressional District. Polaris Industries, Inc. manufactures and distributes quality snowmobiles, among other high-performance motorized products. This employee owned company is just one example of the positive impacts the snowmobile industry has on our economy.
The history of snowmobiling started in Vilas County, 40 years before the very first snowmobile race took place. In fact, Carl Eliason of Sayner, Wisconsin, invented the first snowmobile, which was a snow toboggan, with skis and a track to drive the machine over the snow. By 1964, John and Betty Alward in Eagle River, along with Walter Goldsworthy of nearby Three Lakes, WI, gave the winter economy a boost with the sport of snowmobile racing. The initial news release called this the ``World's First Snowmobile Derby,'' which at the time, was an entirely new concept in winter sports celebrations. Between 2,000 and 3,000 people attended that event in 1964. Today, the World Championship attracts over 30,000.
I am thankful for those who envisioned the snowmobile derby and for those who have made this event an incredible success. Snowmobiling is an important part of Wisconsin's heritage and I ask my colleagues to join me in extending my congratulations on the 50th Anniversary of the Amsoil World Championship Snowmobile Derby in Eagle River, WI.",WI,DUFFY,0.841,R,mr speaker rise today recogn 50th anniversari amsoil world championship snowmobil derbi sunday januari 20 2013 eagl river wisconsin fifti year ago sport snowmobil begun today sport nation econom impact 24 billion addit intern econom impact 13 billion 100 000 fulltim job north america gener snowmobil industri american job includ job manufactur sale tourismrel servic proud snowmobil manufactur facil locat wisconsin seventh congression district polari industri inc manufactur distribut qualiti snowmobil among highperform motor product employe own compani one exampl posit impact snowmobil industri economi histori snowmobil start vila counti 40 year first snowmobil race took place fact carl eliason sayner wisconsin invent first snowmobil snow toboggan ski track drive machin snow 1964 john betti alward eagl river along walter goldsworthi nearbi three lake wi gave winter economi boost sport snowmobil race initi news releas call world first snowmobil derbi time entir new concept winter sport celebr 2 000 3 000 peopl attend event 1964 today world championship attract 30 000 thank envis snowmobil derbi made event incred success snowmobil import part wisconsin heritag ask colleagu join extend congratul 50th anniversari amsoil world championship snowmobil derbi eagl river wi

450,PA.SHUSTER,PA,Shuster,"Mr. Speaker, as the Co-Chairman of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, I rise today to join with the people of Azerbaijan to commemorate the tragic events of ``Black January.''
On January 19, 1990, approximately 26,000 Soviet troops stormed Azerbaijan's capital city of Baku in tanks and armored vehicles. That night, the Soviet military opened indiscriminate fire on peaceful demonstrators, including women and children. As a result of these merciless acts 131 people were killed, 611 were injured, 841 were arrested, and 5 went missing.
The Human Rights Watch report ``Black January in Azerbaijan'' states that ``among the most heinous violations of human rights during the Baku incursion were the numerous attacks on medical personnel, ambulances, and even hospitals.'' The report concludes that the violence used by the Soviet Army constituted an exercise in collective punishment and that the punishment inflicted on Baku by Soviet soldiers may have been intended as a warning to nationalists, not only in Azerbaijan, but in other Republics of the Soviet Union.
Far from crushing the spirit of Azeris, the atrocities of Black January instead consolidated the rising independence movements in the country and united the Azerbaijani nation in its quest for freedom. After 23 years Azerbaijan represents a flourishing country where democratic aspirations of Azerbaijani people have been materialized as they continue diplomatic relations with the United States.
It is my honor to thank the Azerbaijani people for their friendship and to offer my thoughts and prayers to the families of those who gave their lives for the independence of Azerbaijan. I encourage my colleagues to visit the very moving memorial to Black January in Baku that honors the memories of those killed in these attacks by the Soviet military and to join with me today in standing with Azerbaijanis as they commemorate this tragedy.",PA,SHUSTER,0.532,R,mr speaker cochairman congression azerbaijan caucu rise today join peopl azerbaijan commemor tragic event black januari januari 19 1990 approxim 26 000 soviet troop storm azerbaijan capit citi baku tank armor vehicl night soviet militari open indiscrimin fire peac demonstr includ women children result merciless act 131 peopl kill 611 injur 841 arrest 5 went miss human right watch report black januari azerbaijan state among heinou violat human right baku incurs numer attack medic personnel ambul even hospit report conclud violenc use soviet armi constitut exercis collect punish punish inflict baku soviet soldier may intend warn nationalist azerbaijan republ soviet union far crush spirit azeri atroc black januari instead consolid rise independ movement countri unit azerbaijani nation quest freedom 23 year azerbaijan repres flourish countri democrat aspir azerbaijani peopl materi continu diplomat relat unit state honor thank azerbaijani peopl friendship offer thought prayer famili gave live independ azerbaijan encourag colleagu visit move memori black januari baku honor memori kill attack soviet militari join today stand azerbaijani commemor tragedi
451,OR.WALDEN,OR,Walden,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to Umatilla County Sheriff John Trumbo. Sheriff Trumbo retired on January 1, 2013 after a career in law enforcement that dates back to 1973. Since he moved to Pendleton, Oregon in 1977, Sheriff Trumbo has dedicated over thirty-five years of service to the citizens of Umatilla County.
Born and raised in Oregon's Willamette Valley, John learned how to work hard in the family business and later as a crane ``high flyer''. His love for police service began in 1972 when he joined the Benton County Sheriff's office ``Ride Along'' program. A year later John became a reserve officer, serving Benton County, Oregon for nearly four years. During this time he joined his colleagues in Benton County who traveled to Pendleton, Oregon and lent a hand with security for the world famous Pendleton Round-Up and Happy Canyon Pageantry Show. Because of these connections and his work, John was offered a job by the Umatilla County Sheriff.
John took the Sheriff up on this invitation and in 1977 moved to Pendleton, an eastern Oregon wheat ranch and rodeo community which he and his wife Carol never left. His wife Carol, an accomplished school teacher in her own right, was there helping John raise their two sons Nick and Michael who now have blessed them with two loving grandchildren, Presley and Cade. Recently Cade was asked to write about a hero in school and chose his ``good grandpa the Sheriff'' who would be there ``just in case anyone is a criminal.''
For nearly twenty years John served in various roles in the Umatilla County Sheriff's office, officer in the jail, having the first K-9 unit, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain and Under-Sheriff. In 1997, John was sworn in and began his first of sixteen years of service as Umatilla County Sheriff. Always known for his honest and straightforward approach, Sheriff Trumbo was requested and volunteered to participate in many local and state boards, task forces, and councils, including the Governor's Methamphetamine Task Force and the advisory board for Blue Mountain Community College's criminal justice program. He also served as President of the Oregon State Sheriffs Association.
Sheriff Trumbo also implemented programs to aid the citizen of Umatilla County and the region. He organized the nationally recognized Umatilla County Neighborhood Watch and Rural Crime Prevention Program that now has 19 units and over 800 active members. Recognizing the rural nature of Umatilla County and the challenges that are posed, especially in the winter, John implemented an all-terrain vehicle and snowmobile patrol program, for search, rescue, and patrols. Whether it was creating a program to take meth off the streets or sending a bill to a foreign county for the care and feeding of their citizens, Sheriff Trumbo has always looked for simple, straight-forward solutions to solving problems.
Although John has retired as Sheriff, I know he won't be ending his service to Pendleton or Umatilla County. In fact, John remains an active volunteer with the Pendleton Round-Up, serving as the Board of Director who heads up security during the world famous rodeo. In this role he spearheads efforts to provide protection and safety of thousands of people attending the performances and visiting the community, including helping those wayward individuals leaving the ``Let'er Buck'' room stay out of trouble!
I also know he will be spending plenty of well-earned time on those things he loves, whether it is traveling horseback across the county with his grandchildren, woodworking, or camping with his family. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Sheriff John Trumbo the best in his retirement.

453,NY.BISHOP,NY,Bishop,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the 2012 Stony Brook University Baseball team on a record-setting season with its ``Shock the World'' rallying cry.
The Seawolves finished the regular season with a 43-11 record and won their second straight conference regular season title. The team also swept the major conference awards, bringing home Coach of the Year, Player of the Year, and Pitcher of the Year. Twelve players were named all-conference. But the team's success did not end there.
After winning its conference, Stony Brook went on to win the America East Championship for the second time in three seasons. The Seawolves then competed in the Coral Gables Regional of the NCAA tournament. The tournament, attended by four teams, was statistically the toughest regional tournament in the country. The team was able to prevail over the three other competitors and advance to the Super Regional in Baton Rouge.
In the Super Regional, the Seawolves faced the LSU Tigers in a best-of-three tournament. After falling behind in Game 1, the Seawolves won Game 2 to force a winner-take-all Game 3. Although the Tigers took an early lead, the Seawolves won the game to become the first Northeast region school to advance to the College World Series since the end of geographic regional tournaments in 1987.
The Seawolves went to Omaha as the team that had captured the attention and the hearts of observers throughout the country. The team embraced the rallying cry ``Shock the World'' as a mission; it set out to leave a mark on the national stage and make Stony Brook a household name. Unfortunately, the Seawolves were eliminated from the College World Series after a loss to Florida State, but they were successful in their mission to raise the profile of the Stony Brook University athletic program. The question, ``What's a sea wolf?'' is now able to be answered by people who have never set foot on the Stony Brook campus.
By the end of the post-season, Stony Brook had compiled an NCAA-best 52 wins. For the 2011 and 2012 seasons combined, the team has a winning percentage of .777, the best in the nation. In addition to its playoff run, the team reached a number of milestones for its program. Coach Matt Senk became the third coach in the history of the conference to win 6,000 games. The program also had a record seven players drafted in the Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft, including its first player to be drafted in the first round. All seven players have signed with major league organizations.
Stony Brook's remarkable season of triumphs was recognized by the local news media as among the top sports moments of 2012, and the coaches and members of the team were named People of the Year in Sports by a local newspaper. These are a few among the many ways the team has been honored by organizations across Long Island, and I am so very proud to represent this outstanding baseball team and Stony Brook University as their representative in Congress.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of New York's first congressional district, I again congratulate the 2012 Stony Brook University Baseball team on its record-breaking season and wish the program continued success.

454,WI.PETRI,WI,Petri,"Mr. Speaker, in order for our students to be competitive in the global economy, we must do our part to ensure that they are acquiring the knowledge and skills they need for success.
The skills needed for success go beyond the basics of reading, writing, and math, however. When surveyed, employers continually emphasize that, in our 21st century economy, students need to be adept at critical thinking and problem solving; communication; collaboration; and creativity and innovation, in addition to being proficient in core subjects.
Sixteen states, as well as local school districts from across the country, have formed a partnership with over thirty leading education organizations and corporate entities to find ways to strengthen 21st century skills in their K-12 classrooms. However, this momentum isn't sustainable unless federal policy gives states and districts the flexibility to innovate in this direction.
To remedy this, Rep. Dave Loebsack and I are introducing the 21st Century Readiness Act. This bill does not create any new programs or authorize additional spending; instead, it would amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to emphasize the importance of 21st century skills and give states and districts added flexibility to develop and enhance these skills as part of their own initiatives.
A growing coalition of states and school districts has recognized the importance of giving our students the tools they need to succeed in our 21st century workforce. This bill will give them the flexibility to succeed in these efforts.

455,VA.WOLF,VA,Wolf,"Mr. Speaker, I submit a letter I recently sent to over three hundred national faith leaders encouraging them to use their platform and lend their voice to the cause of the persecuted church globally.
Dear Friend: Christians worldwide just celebrated the birth of Jesus. For those of us living in the West, this was a festive season marked by worship services, gift-giving and time with family and friends. But for our brethren in the Middle East, fear of persecution and outright violence or even death cast a long dark shadow over the Christmas holiday. While most striking in the Middle East, given the ancient roots of Christianity in that part of the world, the challenges facing those believers are by no means isolated, nor are they anything ``new under the sun.'' Ecclesiastes 4:1 says, ``I saw the tears of the oppressed, and they have no comforter; power was on the side of the oppressor.'' As you well know, oppression has marked the church since its birth. Consider the chilling words of Roman historian Tacitus regarding the early church: ``Besides being put to death they were made to serve as objects of amusement; they were clad in the hides of beasts and torn to death by dogs; others were crucified, others set on fire to serve to illuminate the night when daylight failed. . .'' Every day, around the world, men and women of faith are imprisoned, beaten, detained, tortured and even killed. The book of Hebrews enjoins us to ``remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.'' Do we suffer with our brethren? Have we in the West ceased to be salt and light? Consider that on our watch a historic exodus of Christians from the Middle East is underway--an exodus fueled by persecution. German Lutheran pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer, faced with the tyranny and horror of Nazism, famously said, ``Silence in the face of evil is itself evil. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.'' And that is precisely what many in the church did, or failed to do, as Hitler unleashed his murderous plans. I recently encountered this haunting account by a German Christian in the book When a Nation Forgets God: ``I lived in Germany during the Nazi Holocaust. I considered myself a Christian. We heard stories of what was happening to the Jews, but we tried to distance ourselves from it, because, what could anyone do to stop it? A railroad track ran behind our small church and each Sunday morning we could hear the whistle in the distance and then the wheels coming over the tracks. We became disturbed when we heard the cries coming from the train as it passed by. We realized that it was carrying Jews like cattle in the cars! Week after week the whistle would blow. We dreaded to hear the sound of those wheels because we knew that we would hear the cries of the Jews en route to a death camp. Their screams tormented us. We knew the time the train was coming and when we heard the whistle blow we began singing hymns. By the time the train came past our church we were singing at the top of our voices. If we heard the screams, we sang more loudly and soon we heard them no more. Years have passed and no one talks about it anymore. But I still hear that train whistle in my sleep. God forgive me; forgive all of us who called ourselves Christians and yet did nothing to intervene.'' The parallels are imperfect but the sentiments are the same. Has our comfort led to complacency? Can the church in the West be galvanized to act? A phrase not often heard outside the majority Muslim world is ``First the Saturday people, then the Sunday people.'' The ``Saturday people'' are of course the Jews. Their once vibrant communities in countries throughout the region are now decimated. In 1948 there were roughly 150,000 Jews in Iraq; today less than 10 remain. In Egypt, there were once as many as 80,000 Jews; now less than 100 remain. It appears a similar fate awaits the ancient Christian community in these same lands. Iraq's Christian population has fallen from as many as 1.4 million in 2003 to between 500,000 and 700,000 today. Churches have been targeted, believers kidnapped for ransom and families threatened with violence if they stay. In October 2010, Islamist extremists laid siege on Our Lady of Salvation Catholic Church in Baghdad killing over 50 hostages and police and wounding dozens more. In Egypt with the ascent of the Muslim Brotherhood, Coptic Christians, numbering roughly 8 to 10 million, are leaving in droves. Ironically, some 2,000 years ago, the Holy Family sought refuge in this same land from the murderous aims of King Herod. In the midst of devastating bloodshed in Syria, the Christian population is particularly vulnerable. A recent ABC News story reported, ``They [Christians] are fearful that Syria will become another Iraq, with Christians caught in the crossfire between rival Islamic groups.'' Over the span of a few decades, the Middle East, with the exception of Israel, was virtually emptied of Jews. The same thing will happen to the Christian community if the current trajectory holds true. And yet, the silence of many in the West is deafening. Such stories receive scant attention in the mainstream media, and perhaps more strikingly, are rarely spoken of from our pulpits. A recent study on Christian persecution released by the British-based think tank Civitas explained the media's seeming ambivalence this way: ``Parts of the media have been influenced by the logical error that equates criticism of Muslims with racism, and therefore as wrong by definition. This has further distracted attention away from the hounding of Christians, helping to cement the surprisingly widespread idea that Christianity is a `Western' faith.'' And yet, we in the church ought to know better. The Middle East is the very cradle of Christendom. Consider Iraq: with the exception of Israel, the Bible contains more references to the cities, regions and nations of ancient Iraq than any other country. The patriarch Abraham came from a city in Iraq called Ur. Isaac's bride, Rebekah, came from northwest Iraq. Jacob spent 20 years in Iraq and his sons (the 12 tribes of Israel) were born in northwest Iraq. A remarkable spiritual revival as told in the book of Jonah occurred in Nineveh. The events of the book of Esther took place in Iraq as did the account of Daniel in the Lion's Den. Furthermore, many of Iraq's Christians still speak Aramaic, the language of Jesus. So how do we account for the Church's indifference? Is it political correctness? Lack of awareness? What tragedy must befall this community before we are propelled to act? The persecution plaguing the Middle East is no exception. Christians are targeted throughout the world in countries like China, Vietnam and Pakistan. According to the Civitas study, ``More Christians are imprisoned in China than in any other country in the world.'' If the faith community in the West isn't engaged, are we surprised when government leaders turn a blind eye to matters of religious freedom? Consider the following: bipartisan legislation to create a special envoy position at the State Department charged with advocating on behalf of religious minorities in the Middle East and South Central Asia overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives more than a year and a half ago. But it remained stalled in the Senate as a result of State Department opposition and the refusal of the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and presumptive secretary of state, John Kerry, to even hold a hearing on the legislation. I have had the privilege of meeting individuals who boldly follow Jesus despite unbelievably hostile circumstances. Shabbaz Bhatti, Pakistan's federal minister for minority affairs, and the only Christian Member of the cabinet and an outspoken critic of his country's blasphemy laws, was one such man. On March 2, 2011 he was murdered, his car riddled with bullets, leaving his mother's house for work. In a video filmed shortly before his assassination (accessible on my Web site at ), Bhatti appears to sense that the path he has chosen will come with a price. When asked about the threats against his life, he said, without malice or fear, ``I believe in Jesus Christ who has given his own life for us. I know what is the meaning of [the] cross. And I am following the cross. And I am ready to die for a cause.'' And so he did. The book of Proverbs tells us to ``Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves . . .'' Bhatti can no longer speak. The Chinese bishop under house arrest cannot speak. The North Korean believer enslaved in the gulag can't speak. The Iraqi nun fearing for her life cannot speak. Will we be their voice? Martin Luther King, Jr. famously said, ``In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.'' Are we not their friends? The Church globally is under assault. Our response must not be to simply sing more loudly, thereby drowning out the cries for help from our brothers and sisters. Rather we must speak out, advocate and act on their behalf. From my perspective the Church in the West, specifically in America, is failing in this regard. Can you, as a leader in the Church, help? Are you pained by these accounts of persecution? Do you have ideas about how best to respond? Will you use your sphere of influence to raise the profile of this issue--be it through a sermon, writing or media interview? I welcome your thoughts and invite your engagement in this monumental task. Next week, when Congress reconvenes, I intend to reintroduce the special envoy legislation and press for passage in both houses of Congress. I don't pretend to think that a special envoy will single-handedly solve the problem, but it certainly can't hurt to have a high-level person within the State Department bureaucracy who is exclusively focused on the protection and preservation of these ancient communities. Furthermore, to do nothing is simply not an option. We in the West must speak out on behalf of the persecuted church around the world. Best wishes. Sincerely, Frank R. Wolf, Member of Congress. P.S. I know you are busy and have so many competing priorities but your involvement could really make a difference in the lives of believers around the

457,MO.LONG,MO,Long,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Congenital Heart Defect Awareness Week, which is February 7th-14th.
This week is dedicated to the millions of Americans who have been diagnosed with Congenital Heart Defects, the challenges their families face and for the families of those who have sadly lost loved ones to this condition. Congenital Heart Disease is considered to be the most common birth defect and is also the leading cause of birth defect related deaths worldwide.
Each year approximately forty thousand babies are born in the United States with Congenital Heart Defects and some remain undiagnosed for months or even years after birth. This dangerous condition, if left undiagnosed, can cause sudden cardiac death especially in young adolescent athletes.
Unfortunately, despite these statistics, newborns and young athletes are not routinely screened for Congenital Heart Defects and funding for research regarding the condition is limited.
Mr. Speaker, Congenital Heart Defects affect millions of Americans and I rise to recognize those affected by this condition and to help bring awareness to this important cause.

458,CA.CALVERT,CA,Calvert,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to southern California are exceptional. Our community has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Claudia Luppino is one of these individuals. On Friday, January 4, 2013, Claudia ended her tenure as the Area Director for the Inland Area jurisdiction of the Social Security Administration (SSA) after 37 years of service.
Claudia grew up in Erie, Pennsylvania, where she and her future husband Bud were high school sweethearts. After graduating from Erie Business College, the young military wife began her government career with the U.S. Army Computer Systems Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, later transferring to March Air Force Base in Riverside. In 1977, after Bud left the Air Force, she began her career with Social Security as the Administrative Aide in the Riverside District office. Since then, she has held more than a dozen positions with the Agency, including Claims Representative, Operations Analyst and Operations Supervisor.
In 1985 Claudia was selected as the Area Analyst in the Inland Area Director's Office (ADO), and in 1987 she became the District Manager in the Redlands Office, where she served for two years before being selected as the Operations Officer in San Bernardino. In 1993 Claudia rejoined the Inland ADO as the Area Administrative Assistant, and later went on to serve as the Assistant District Manager in Palm Springs, District Manager in North Las Vegas, District Manager in Victorville, Deputy Area Director in the Inland Area Director's Office and the District Manager for the Riverside District. Claudia is a graduate of the Region IX Leadership Development Program and has received numerous awards, including the Regional Commissioner's Citation.
Claudia recently concluded an assignment as the Acting Area Director in the Los Angeles Metro Area. She served for over six months as the Acting Area Director in the Inland Area, where she oversaw 540 employees in 16 offices in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and all of Nevada. It was a responsibility she took seriously. According to her, ``There is no other government agency that provides the critical services SSA does, providing retirement, survivors and disability benefits as well as Supplemental Security Income benefits to the American public.'' What she will miss most about her job, she said, ``is that very ability to make a difference in the lives of so many people.''
In her retirement, Claudia plans to help her husband Bud with his business, Bud's Tire and Wheel, Inc. in Riverside, and a shop in Moreno Valley. They will soon begin construction on a third location in Riverside. She also looks forward to traveling more, learning Italian and spending time with her three grandsons.
In light of all Claudia has done for southern California seniors, it is only fitting that she be honored for her many years of dedicated service. Claudia's tireless passion for public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Inland Empire and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she retires.",CA,CALVERT,0.536,R,mr speaker rise today honor pay tribut individu whose dedic contribut southern california except commun fortun dynam dedic leader willingli unselfishli give time talent make commun better place live work claudia luppino one individu friday januari 4 2013 claudia end tenur area director inland area jurisdict social secur administr ssa 37 year servic claudia grew eri pennsylvania futur husband bud high school sweetheart graduat eri busi colleg young militari wife began govern career u armi comput system command fort belvoir virginia later transfer march air forc base riversid 1977 bud left air forc began career social secur administr aid riversid district offic sinc held dozen posit agenc includ claim repres oper analyst oper supervisor 1985 claudia select area analyst inland area director offic ado 1987 becam district manag redland offic serv two year select oper offic san bernardino 1993 claudia rejoin inland ado area administr assist later went serv assist district manag palm spring district manag north la vega district manag victorvil deputi area director inland area director offic district manag riversid district claudia graduat region ix leadership develop program receiv numer award includ region commission citat claudia recent conclud assign act area director lo angel metro area serv six month act area director inland area oversaw 540 employe 16 offic riversid san bernardino counti nevada respons took serious accord govern agenc provid critic servic ssa provid retir survivor disabl benefit well supplement secur incom benefit american public miss job said abil make differ live mani peopl retir claudia plan help husband bud busi bud tire wheel inc riversid shop moreno valley soon begin construct third locat riversid also look forward travel learn italian spend time three grandson light claudia done southern california senior fit honor mani year dedic servic claudia tireless passion public servic contribut immens better inland empir proud call fellow commun member american friend know mani commun member grate servic salut retir
459,NJ.PALLONE,NJ,Pallone,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Steven Goldstein as he embarks on a new venture in life. Mr. Goldstein has worked tirelessly on behalf of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community in New Jersey and it is my honor to celebrate him at Garden State Equality's Inauguration Brunch.
Steven Goldstein founded Garden State Equality in 2004 and has since led it as CEO and Chair. During his tenure, Garden State Equality has seen 213 LGBT civil rights laws enacted in N.J. A proponent of equal rights for all, Garden State Equality, under Mr. Goldstein's leadership, also advocated for anti-bullying laws and created programs aimed at helping N.J.'s youth. As Mr. Goldstein passes on the torch as CEO and Chair of Garden State Equality to pursue a new career as Associate Chancellor for External Affairs at Rutgers University--Newark, he remains committed to the organization and its cause and will serve as its Honorary Chair on the Board and executive committee.
Mr. Goldstein earned a B.A. from Brandeis University, an M.P.P. from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, an M.S. from the Columbia School of Journalism and a J.D. from Columbia Law School. In addition to his time at Garden State Equality, Mr. Goldstein's resume includes working as a senior staff member in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, a co-campaign manager of a U.S. Senate campaign in N.J., a television producer and an educator. He also endeavors to become a rabbi and is working toward that goal.

460,MO.CLAY,MO,Clay,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great American who leaves this body today to return to the private sector, my wonderful friend from Cape Girardeau . . . Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson. Her retirement is a great loss to the citizens of southeast Missouri, to our State, and to our Nation.
As the outgoing dean of Missouri's congressional delegation, she has led our group with fairness, respect, and a spirit of cooperation. As she retires today, I know that every member of the Missouri delegation, as well as her many friends on both sides of the aisle, join me in congratulating her on an exceptional career in the U.S. House. Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson has represented southeast Missouri with honor and integrity and in the face of so much discord, so much distortion, and too often, an inability to compromise,
Jo Ann has always been a voice of calm, reason, and good common sense. There is no doubt that the center aisle caucus will miss her strong, principled leadership. Congresswoman Emerson is a member who searches for common ground . . .
Both out of instinct and because of her deeply held belief that Congress was sent here to work together to solve problems, not to obstruct the government, not to incite intolerance or rancor, not to set one region of the country against the other, but to seek out, and then support a common agenda that will do the most good for America.
That is how Jo Ann has lived her life, and that is how she has served. Congresswoman Emerson is a skilled legislator, she is a wonderful colleague, and she is a great friend of mine. Congresswoman Emerson represents the best of Missouri.
I will miss her wise voice as Democrats and Republicans seek common ground to move the Nation forward. My only consolation on her retirement, is the knowledge that my good friend, her husband, attorney Ron Gladney, and their wonderful children . . . will finally have their wife and mother back. And that is a great family blessing that we should all understand and appreciate. From the dark days immediately after she assumed the congressional seat of her late husband . . . Congressman Bill Emerson.
Jo Ann has brought the Missouri values of common sense, family, community, faith, and freedom to the floor every day.
I shall miss her wisdom, her kindness, and her decency, and I know that our State, this honorable body, and our Nation will be forever grateful for her service.

These are extremely difficult economic times. We are in a debt crisis that will require sacrifices on the part of all Americans.

My legislation will honor any retirement benefits accrued prior to the passage of this bill and will keep Social Security and the Thrift Savings Plan in place for Members of Congress.

468,CA.ESHOO,CA,Eshoo,"Mr. Speaker, consider the following: if the United States had an adopted policy of equal pay, it would put $200 billion more into the economy every year. That comes out to about $137 for every white woman per paycheck and to approximately $300 for every woman of color, who is doubly discriminated against. These women are not going to put their money into a Cayman Islands bank account. Instead, they'll spend it; and this will boost our economy, create jobs and help families.
With a record number of women in the workforce, wage discrimination hurts the majority of American families both in terms of their economic security today and their retirement security tomorrow. The Institute for Women's Policy Research found that wage disparity will cost women anywhere from $400,000 to $2 million over a lifetime of lost wages. That means fewer resources to pay the mortgage, to send kids to college, or to have a decent retirement. Also, due to rising employment rates, an unprecedented number of women are now the family breadwinners, making pay equity even more critical, not simply to family economic security but also to the Nation's economic recovery.
As we look for ways to create more jobs and grow the economy, it is astounding to me that Congress has not yet passed legislation ensuring equal pay for equal work. It is a powerful policy with what would be powerful and positive economic outcomes. That is why I support the Paycheck Fairness Act. It ensures that employers who try to justify paying a man more than a woman for the same job must show that the disparity is not sex-based, but job-related and necessary. It prohibits employers from retaliating against employees who discuss or disclose their own salary information with their coworkers, and it strengthens the remedies available to wronged employees.
Pay inequity due to gender discrimination is real, and it should not be tolerated. The House of Representatives should address this issue.",CA,ESHOO,-0.371,D,mr speaker consid follow unit state adopt polici equal pay would put 200 billion economi everi year come 137 everi white woman per paycheck approxim 300 everi woman color doubli discrimin women go put money cayman island bank account instead theyll spend boost economi creat job help famili record number women workforc wage discrimin hurt major american famili term econom secur today retir secur tomorrow institut women polici research found wage dispar cost women anywher 400 000 2 million lifetim lost wage mean fewer resourc pay mortgag send kid colleg decent retir also due rise employ rate unpreced number women famili breadwinn make pay equiti even critic simpli famili econom secur also nation econom recoveri look way creat job grow economi astound congress yet pass legisl ensur equal pay equal work power polici would power posit econom outcom support paycheck fair act ensur employ tri justifi pay man woman job must show dispar sexbas jobrel necessari prohibit employ retali employe discuss disclos salari inform cowork strengthen remedi avail wrong employe pay inequ due gender discrimin real toler hous repres address issu
469,SC.WILSON,SC,Wilson,"Mr. Speaker, the primary reason the government is in economic turmoil and is destroying jobs is due to a lack of fiscal responsibility.
The House has fulfilled the most basic responsibility of governing and passing a budget. On the other hand, the liberal-controlled Senate has failed to complete a budget for nearly 4 years. Hardworking American families and small businesses plan to spend within their means and abide by a budget. The Federal Government should do so as well.
Today, House Republicans will consider legislation aimed at putting this fiscal irresponsibility to a halt by voting on the No Budget, No Pay Act. This bill will raise the debt ceiling for 3 months with the provision that both Houses of Congress must pass a budget. If either body fails to achieve the task, the Members' pay will be withheld.
It is past time to hold the President and the liberal-controlled Senate accountable for out-of-control spending. If hardworking Americans strive to succeed in their jobs, the Senate must do so as well.

On January 22, 1973, this monumental decision came as a result of decades of relentless activism and litigation on the part of great women advocates; but today, there are still those who would prefer to roll back these fundamental rights and turn the clock back on women's health care.

471,CA.MCCLINTOCK,CA,McClintock,"Mr. Speaker, the House is poised to pass H.R. 325 today. I respect the sincerity of its supporters, but I must firmly dissent.
This bill accommodates spending at ruinous levels far beyond the limits set by the House budget. It sets a terrible precedent by abolishing the debt limit for nearly 4 months, giving an unlimited credit card to this administration. I think Members will be stunned by the borrowing that this moratorium makes possible. Certainly, thousands of dollars of new debt will be heaped on every household in America.
House Republicans have passed two budget plans that put our Nation back on a path toward fiscal solvency. If the debt limit were increased within that trajectory at 2-month intervals, it would require only small and incremental reforms each time.

472,AL.BACHUS,AL,Bachus,"Mr. Speaker, let me rise to announce bipartisan legislation that my good friend and colleague, Terri Sewell, and I are introducing today to honor the four little girls that were killed in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham with the Congressional Gold Medal.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of this pivotal event in the history of the civil rights movement, which less than a year later resulted in the passage of the Civil Rights Act. We know today that the evil that occurred in this place of God on September 15, 1963, galvanized the conscience of the Nation and led to the passage of laws to ensure equal rights for every American.
The innocent young children killed in the bombing--Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley, and Denise McNair--were eulogized as martyred heroines by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and it is fitting and proper that this Congress recognize the historic significance of their lives.
Ironically, they were studying about the love and forgiveness of God at the time of their death. Let us be mindful that despite this act of violence and the killing of a young 16-year-old black boy and 14-year-old black boy the same day, the civil rights leaders were committed to nonviolence, and they kept true to that commitment.
Despite the violence done to them, they showed forgiveness against the people, and our colleague John Lewis and others helped us avoid, by their commitment to nonviolence, the calamities and replaying of grievances that have destroyed the fabric of many other countries.

We on the House Budget Committee work hard to pass a responsible budget each year, but the Democrat-controlled Senate refuses to do the same. In fact, it has been nearly 4 years since the Senate has passed a budget. Since that time, the Federal Government has racked up annual deficits exceeding $1 trillion; and, in total, more than $5 trillion has been added to our national debt in just 4 years. If we stay on our current path of record deficits, big government and unfunded entitlement programs, Greece's present will be America's future.
A massive debt crisis is surely not the future we want for our children or our grandchildren. Fiscal responsibility and accountability in the Halls of Congress cannot wait.

474,KY.YARMUTH,KY,Yarmuth,"Mr. Speaker, after the massacre of 20 children and six educators in Connecticut, we've heard the predictable rantings of people who are convinced beyond all reason and evidence that the Federal Government intends to take their guns away.
I am sad that they have succumbed to the fear-mongering of the National Rifle Association and others who really only want to sell more guns. It's more than sad. Frankly, it's dangerous when a government leader stoops to the same fear-mongering for political purposes.
Last week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's campaign sent out an email titled, ``Watch out. They're Coming for Your Guns.'' Among the email's dishonest claims was this blatant distortion:
President Obama is spelling out the 23 different executive orders he will take to get your guns.
Those 23 executive actions are so modest that even gun rights activists have said they have no problem with them. In fact, many of them reflect proposals made by the NRA.
Even if we give Senator McConnell the benefit of the doubt as to whether he actually knew what his campaign manager was putting out, he is responsible, as we all are, for what our employees do in our name.

483,KY.BARR,KY,Barr,"Mr. Speaker, when I graduated from Henry Clay High School in Lexington, Kentucky, just over 20 years ago, I had little notion that I would stand before you today occupying the seat which the Great Compromiser himself once held.
Henry Clay was first elected to this House in 1811 becoming the only person elected as Speaker the same day he took office. During his remarkable four decades on the national stage, he steered America through a daunting array of crises, each of which might have shattered the Union absent his remarkable leadership.
Indeed, Henry Clay demonstrated that an unwavering dedication to principle and a practical commitment to compromise are not incompatible values. They are, instead, the tools of statesmanship, the implements of progress, and the guardians of freedom.
He was Abraham Lincoln's ``beau ideal of a great man.'' Eulogizing Clay in 1852, Lincoln called him ``the man for a crisis,'' declaring that Clay ``desired the prosperity of his countrymen partly because they were his countrymen, but chiefly to show the world that freemen could be prosperous.
Henry Clay understood the indispensable link between liberty, prosperity, and basic human dignity. His struggle to harness our system of checks and balances to serve these goals echoes across the generations. The process was messy, and the path ahead was fraught with danger and uncertainty; but the Great Compromiser governed in the national interest without comprising himself or forgetting who sent him there.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored, indeed I am awed, by the legacy of Henry Clay and the exceptional men who followed him; but I did not come here as the self-styled heir to that legacy.
Instead, I came here as a father concerned about his children's future. I came here as a Kentuckian determined to fight for my State's signature industries. And I came here as an American committed to restoring the American Dream.
My district, in central and eastern Kentucky, offers a panoramic view of the values, dreams, and passions that have animated our Nation since its beginnings. Historically anchored in Kentucky's bluegrass region, the Sixth District now extends to the Appalachian foothills, bordering the coalfields of the Cumberland Plateau.
We are perhaps most recognized as the horse capital of the world. Indeed, the world came to Kentucky just over 2 years ago when Lexington hosted the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games. Yet that event offers just the latest example of our State's deep integration with the global economy.
Georgetown, Kentucky, is home to the largest Toyota manufacturing facility outside of Japan, a facility which provides 7,000 well-paying jobs that produces the Camry, the most popular American-made car in the United States.
These jobs in turn rely upon some of the lowest electricity costs in the Nation, which Kentucky's coal industry makes possible. Having endured the astonishing assault of the war on coal during the last 4 years, Kentucky's coal industry continues to offer the reality of affordable energy today and the promise of an affordable, reliable, and clean source of American energy for centuries to come.
Kentuckians are also capitalizing upon our State's enormous potential for tourism through creative initiatives like the Bourbon Trail, which now draws an estimated 400,000 visitors every year. We are introducing the world to our special distilling heritage.
The Sixth District offers a number of historic treasures, such as Daniel Boone's settlement, Fort Boonesborough, and in Frankfort, even our new State capitol and executive mansion are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Plus, tourists and residents alike can enjoy natural attractions of stunning majesty, such as Red River Gorge, Natural Bridge, and Cave Run, which provide almost limitless opportunities for outdoor recreation.
The Sixth District also remains home to a diverse and thriving agricultural economy. We are best known for tobacco, but many people may not know that Kentucky possesses more head of cattle than any State east of the Mississippi.
These industries are supported with colleges and universities filled with outstanding teaching and research professionals. Institutions like the University of Kentucky--my alma mater--Eastern Kentucky University, Transylvania University, Kentucky State University, Georgetown College, Midway College, and the members of our community and technical college system.
The University of Kentucky is well-known for its proud tradition of college basketball, having won eight national championships, most recently in 2012.
Underlying all of these success stories is the unique pride and attachment to place that distinguishes Kentuckians wherever you find us. Our State's pioneer heritage survives as the well-spring of our determination to survive and excel against overwhelming odds. No matter the challenge, we will persevere. We will lead. And with God's help, we will prosper together. 
Mr. Speaker, I am humbled beyond measure to represent a people who embody the spirit, the generosity, and the creativity that define America's greatness. I pray that my service proves equal to their trust.
Through the lens of time, Henry Clay appears larger than life, yet our Republic has a habit of producing the right men and women at the right time. Together, let's strive after Henry Clay's model of leadership. Given the gravity of our challenge, each of us must.

485,VA.WOLF,VA,Wolf,"Mr. Speaker, more than 4 months have passed since the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, which killed four Americans, including our ambassador, injured many others, and destroyed two U.S. facilities. Yet, despite the months that have passed, we're hardly closer to bringing those responsible to justice than we were in the weeks immediately following the attack. Put bluntly, the lack of progress in identifying and hunting down the terrorists responsible is stunning.
Consider the current state of the Obama administration's investigation and response to the attack:
Four months later, the administration still cannot or will not name the terrorist groups responsible for the attacks or the names of these group leaders;
Four months later, despite consulate video footage that many Members of Congress have seen and many eyewitnesses, not a single Benghazi terror suspect is in custody;
Four months later, the FBI has had access to only one suspect, Ali Harzi, for just 3 hours, and the Tunisian Government kept the FBI team waiting for more than 5 weeks before finally granting access;
Four months later, the administration still has not disclosed the serious connections between the groups behind the Benghazi attack and the leaders of the attack on the U.S. embassies in Cairo, Tunis, and Sana'a that same week of September 11;
Four months later, following the release of the Pickering report on State Department failures leading up to the attack, not a single State Department employee has been fired and held responsible for their role in denying adequate security for the consulate in Benghazi;
Four months later, despite Secretary Clinton's September 21 declaration when she said, ``What happened was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans,'' this administration seems to have not only rested, but to have moved on and apparently hopes that the Congress and the American people will too.
Just today, the New York Times is reporting:
Several Egyptian members of the squad of militants that lay bloody siege to an Algerian gas complex last week also took part in the deadly attack on the United States Mission in Libya in September.
Mr. Speaker, 4 months later, this is an unacceptable state of affairs. Quite frankly, the Obama administration has failed. They have failed to prioritize this investigation. They have failed to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Libyan, Tunisian, and Egyptian Governments. But more fundamentally, the administration has failed to respond to a terrorist attack appropriately, treating it as a law enforcement and diplomatic issue, rather than the security issue that it is.
At its core, this is yet another reflection of President Obama's schizophrenic counterterrorism policy, the same administration that unapologetically rains down lethal drone attacks on some al Qaeda affiliate terrorists in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia and will not use other counterterrorism resources to identify, locate, and detain the terrorists involved in the death of our ambassador and others in Libya.
This inconsistent policy may stem from the President's hasty campaign promise to shut down Guantanamo Bay in Gitmo and prematurely transfer detention facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan. In doing so, the President effectively ended America's ability to detain and interrogate terrorists, depriving the FBI, the CIA, and other agencies of critical opportunities to obtain information on al Qaeda networks.
Today, as the case of Benghazi suspect Ali Harzi has demonstrated, the United States is completely reliant on the cooperation of host countries to detain on our behalf and selectively allow access to suspects. As in the case of Harzi, as demonstrated, this approach is fraught with diplomatic roadblocks, costing critical time in getting information from suspects to track terrorist networks. Perhaps that is why President Obama so often opts to use lethal drone strikes to kill terrorists, knowing that the U.S. would be unable to get access to interrogate these terror suspects by working through host governments or because he no longer has a way to detain them in U.S. custody short of providing them the full privileges of an article III court.
In short, the President has tied his own hands, compromised U.S. national security and put the FBI in an impossible position. The FBI has been asked to treat the terrorist attack where four Americans died as if it's a law enforcement activity and has been put in a compromised and very difficult spot, and they have laid the groundwork for the administration's inept response in the wake of the terrorist attack in Benghazi.
To make matters worse, the administration has not even seen any significant success from its diplomatic-focused response. When Tunisia refused to allow the FBI access to Harzi for more than 5 weeks, the administration took no public steps to use diplomatic tools, like U.S. foreign assistance, to pressure the Tunisians to make Harzi available. In fact, the FBI only gained access after Members of Congress threatened amendments to cut off or restrict Tunisia's foreign aid if they continued to obstruct the FBI investigation.
I was among those Members of Congress along with Lindsey Graham and Senator McCain and others. In the interim, I urged the administration to act immediately to suspend foreign assistance if the Tunisian Government persisted in obstructing the investigation. On January 4, I received a tepid--and it was tepid--response from the Acting Deputy Assistant Administrator for Legislative and Public Affairs at USAID with a bland assurance that the Tunisian Government was cooperating. Was cooperating? Five weeks and the FBI had to wait? Then the FBI had 3 hours to talk to him, and we gave this Tunisian Government, Mr. Speaker, $320 million last year? Days later, Ali Harzi was released.
Today, I again wrote USAID, expressing my disappointment that the administrator himself could not respond directly to a Member of Congress who serves on a committee of jurisdiction and, further, pointed out what should be obvious--that the Tunisian Government did not cooperate. The Tunisian Government never seriously thought the aid--precious taxpayer money--was in jeopardy. The Tunisian Government has not faced a single consequence for undermining U.S. national security. I submit my letter for the Record.
Sadly, the failure to respond forcefully and appropriately to the Benghazi attack will undoubtedly encourage our enemies and make the world a more dangerous place for Americans working in hostile environments around the world. This failure to respond has endangered future Embassy staffs and Ambassadors--the Federal employees who serve our country at great risk.
Rather than demonstrating that there will be no quarter, no respite, no safe haven for terrorists who threaten American officials abroad, the message the administration has sent is that there is no apparent consequence for these actions. This will only embolden our enemy to plan the next Benghazi, knowing that under this administration there is less consequence even for their involvement in such an attack.
In this context, perhaps it is not surprising that the al Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group Ansar al-Sharia brazenly took pictures of the FBI agents interviewing Harzi and posted pictures on their Web sites; and when the Tunisian Government released Harzi, Ansar al- Sharia was there to welcome him and post a video of the celebration of his release. Again, these antagonistic actions have been met by silence from this administration.
As Steve Hayes and Tom Joscelyn reported in The Weekly Standard this week:
U.S. officials tell The Weekly Standard that the release of the photos was a clear attempt to intimidate the Americans and show that the FBI could not act with impunity.
In its posting, Ansar al-Sharia Tunisia warned the Tunisian people that their government had allowed the FBI ``to begin investigating your sons under post-revolutionary protection.''
Consider that, in the same week of the Benghazi attack, our Embassies in Cairo, Tunis and Sana were also overrun in an increasingly apparent coordinated plot. In each case, the American flag was ripped down and burned, and a black al Qaeda flag was flown in its place. We are fortunate and blessed that none of these incidents resulted in a loss of life. They were, nonetheless, an attack on America by hostile groups.
As the administration's own State Department Web site states: ``Any attack on an Embassy is considered an attack on the country it represents.'' Each Embassy and consulate that was overrun the week of September 11 represents, in its own way, a public attack on America, and in the months that have followed, this administration has demonstrated that there are no consequences for breaching our Embassies or for killing our personnel.
I fear that the latest hostage-taking and killing of Americans and other Westerners in Algeria is a manifestation of a newfound confidence by our enemy in knowing that they may face no serious consequences from this administration for their murderous acts. It is telling that neither President Obama nor any others in his administration have made a public statement on the recent terrorist activities in Algeria, whereas the head of France and the head of England have spoken out over and over and over.
All the while, the Arab Spring, which was fanned by this administration to much fanfare, has become an Arab Winter, and for many of the people in the Middle East and North Africa, this Arab Winter--a new safe haven for al Qaeda-affiliated groups--is forming, ideologically fueled by the release of terrorists and extremists from prisons and flush with weapons provided to anti-Qadhafi rebels last year.
We are witnessing the potential formation of the next front in the war on terror, but we increasingly have an administration that no longer considers it a war worth fighting no matter the cost to American power or to the safety of our people abroad. While some have described the Obama doctrine as leading from behind, it is increasingly clear that the Obama doctrine means not leading at all. While most of the responsibility falls on the President and his administration, the Congress--the House and the Senate--and the media share some blame for failing to adequately investigate and bring attention to the many questions surrounding the administration's response to Benghazi.
Aside from a handful of reporters who have stayed with this story and have continued to raise questions about the administration's words and deeds, I can't help but wonder: Where are the New York Times, the Washington Post, or the network news programs? Why in the wake of last week's deadly terrorist attack in Algeria are no reporters investigating the serious links between al Qaeda's affiliates in North Africa and the connection between the groups?
Equally important, where has the Congress been in investigating both the circumstances of the attack and the administration's response over the last 4 months? Despite a handful of hearings, many in classified settings and done by very capable and good people, the American people have not been provided with anything close to an adequate answer to the following questions. It is not only important for the Congress to find out; it is important for the American people to find out. Have they been given answers to these questions?
Secretary Panetta, Attorney General Holder and DNI Clapper still have not testified publicly before Congress as to what steps they took during the attack and in the days that followed.
What were the President's activities during the 7-hour period of attack?
Why wasn't the U.S. military deployed to assist?
On the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack in American history and after multiple attacks this year on U.S. and Western interests, why were U.S. military units and assets in the region not ready, alert, and in a position to respond? After all, two of the four people killed were murdered 7 hours after the fighting began.
Why do we still not have the clear answers on the internal process that produced the inaccurate and, frankly, misleading talking points on which Ambassador Rice relied several days after the attack?
Why were the testimonies of the U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi on September 12--eyewitnesses who knew there was never a demonstration outside the consulate--not immediately factored into the judgments of our intelligence community?
Have the witnesses who were there on the scene, government employees, good people--all risking their lives--been called to come up and been given the opportunity to talk to Members on both sides of the aisle? The answer to date is ``no.''
Why hasn't Secretary Clinton been interviewed by the Pickering Commission?
Was the White House aware of the FBI investigation of General Petraeus? If not, why not?
To date, Congress has failed to get these answers, and it has not developed a coordinated or substantial investigative plan to fully explore this critical matter, which has a direct bearing on U.S. national security. In the absence of serious oversight, the media has moved on. In the absence of this, the administration, which has so much to account for to the American people, receives a carte blanche from the legislative branch to continue its questionable policies.
These matters are too serious to be brushed aside. There are critical legislative decisions the next Congress will have to make based on answers to these questions; but, more importantly, the American people deserve the answers to these questions, including open hearings and an unclassified report.
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons I remain convinced that a House select committee on the terrorist attack in Benghazi is needed more than ever. That is why last week I introduced my resolution, H. Res. 36, with 20 of our colleagues joining as cosponsors.
A select committee is essential to combine the myriad existing investigations into a single, comprehensive, and exhaustive review. I believe such a combined effort will yield even more information regarding the true nature of these terrorist attacks and the administration's response will not allow administration officials to offer up siloed accounts to various committees.
The select committee I am proposing should draw from the existing congressional investigations by including the chairman and ranking member of each committee of jurisdiction--the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Rogers and Mr. Ruppersberger have done a great job; the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel do a great job; the Judiciary Committee, the same way; the Armed Services Committee; the Homeland Security Committee; the Oversight and Government Reform Committee; as well as five additional Republican Members appointed by the Speaker and two additional Democrats appointed by the minority leader so it is truly bipartisan.
I appreciate the support I've received for this resolution from the original cosponsors, as well as the Heritage Foundation; former Senator from Tennessee, Fred Thompson, who was counsel on the Watergate Select Committee; former Ambassador John Bolton; and General Jerry Boykin, a former special operations officer and CIA operative who is widely respected in the intelligence community.
Mr. Speaker and Members of this body, we owe it to the families of the victims and the American people to fully investigate this terrorist attack. I urge my colleagues to support my resolution to create a House select committee.
I yield back the balance of my time.
Dear Dr. Shah: Ms. Barbara Bennett, acting deputy assistant administrator for legislative and public affairs at USAID recently sent a response to my December 11, 2012 letter to you. I was disappointed you did not respond directly to a Member of Congress who serves on a committee of jurisdiction, especially given that my concern was budgetary in nature. Just days after I received your response, Tunisian authorities released Ali Harzi, a key suspect in the September 11 terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate and annex in Benghazi, which took the lives of four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador, and resulted in the destruction of two U.S. facilities. This development is completely at odds with USAID's assurances in the response letter that ``. . . Tunisian authorities are cooperating with the Department [State] through normal law enforcement channels.'' Respectfully, I would also like to remind you that I chair the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Consequently, while Ms. Bennett indicated that USAID ``could not provide further detail,'' I am well-versed on the investigation and can say with confidence that releasing Ali Harzi is an affront to U.S. national security and rule of law, given the evidence of his alleged involvement. Furthermore, your assertion that U.S. assistance is critical to ``Tunisia's successful democratic transition'' is misguided. Tunisia is not transitioning successfully. I have enclosed for your review a recent piece which ran in Bloomberg Businessweek, ``Revolution and Entropy,'' which paints a bleak picture of progress in Tunisia. A January 14 Reuters piece described large street protests in the capital city during which protestors chanted, ``Where is the constitution? Where is democracy?'' Democratic transition aside, the Tunisian government, as evidenced by this most recent development with Ali Harzi, is working at cross- purposes with U.S. national interests. During these tight budgetary times, when worthy programs face constraints and cuts, our national priorities should undergird our foreign assistance. The administration continues to claim that bringing the perpetrators to justice for the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate is a priority. And yet its actions are inconsistent with such sentiments, particularly in the case of Tunisia. We must send a clear and unequivocal message to the Tunisian government. U.S. aid must not be taken for granted. U.S. national security considerations are a cornerstone of our foreign policy. When those interests are undermined, there are consequences. I look forward to a personal response to this letter and any future correspondence. Best wishes. Sincerely, Frank R.

486,TX.GOHMERT,TX,Gohmert,"Mr. Speaker, just very briefly, we had a vote today. There's some wonderfully fine Members of Congress that I have deep respect for who voted ``yes,'' and 32 voted ``no'' from the Republican side. It's not because we don't all hold the same belief that we have to cut spending to be responsible, to avoid continuing to add debt to our children and grandchildren, but a matter of difference in strategy. It is a mistake to suspend the debt ceiling increase, just as it would be to raise the debt ceiling without any meaningful cuts, just as Senator Phil Gramm got back in 1985, I believe it was, with Gramm-Rudman and so many of the debt ceiling increases that were accompanied as part of the deal with restrictions on spending.
There're so many things going on in the world today that are just staggering. We know we had Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testifying today. One report here today says that Secretary Clinton interrupted one Senator to contradict him and stress that she did not see requests for additional security to protect the Benghazi mission.
That's extremely unfortunate that people in our State Department, committed to helping this country, would make cries for help over a period of months, over a period of years, even going back to when Ambassador Rice was with the State Department and people were killed at an American embassy and a request had been made for extra security that went unheeded.
Here it came again; and apparently there were a number of people who made requests, including one of the security officials that I met and talked to personally. They could see that we were sitting ducks. And apparently former Senator Clinton, now Secretary Clinton, is saying she never saw the request. The bucks would have stopped with her if they'd ever made it to her. What it says is something has got to be done so that when people who have dedicated their lives to helping and protecting this country cry for help, that months, years after the cries, we don't again come back and say: never heard the cries; never got to me.
Tragic. Tragic.
Senator, now-Secretary, Clinton said that the administration's response to the assault was to be defended, and an independent investigation found that the State's actions saved American lives in real-time.
Well, from what I've seen on the House side and in the news, without going into anything that might be classified, just from the public information we've discerned, the actions of the State Department in failing and ignoring the requests for help did not save lives. It ended up costing lives.
The failure of this President to either receive information when a United States Ambassador he put in harm's way was begging, was under fire and people were begging for help on his behalf, we've had people indicate, gee, that immediately gets to the President himself or someone directly around the President who can get the President's immediate attention. We have an Ambassador under attack; that goes straight to the President or somebody right around him.
And just like Secretary Clinton apparently has testified today: I never saw or heard the cries for help. I didn't know.
Well, since this President is going to be in office for 4 more years as of Monday, it is imperative that he clean house and set up new procedures so that even if he's out golfing, even if he's on vacation, body surfing in Hawaii, wherever he is, doing fund-raising in Las Vegas, no matter where he is, that when somebody says Mr. President, people that you put in harm's way are begging for help, they're under attack, they're begging for your help, and I feel sure, you know, he would take time off of one of the greens or body surfing. He would surely take time. I know he would. If somebody would get him the information, your Ambassador is about to be killed, I know he would walk off the green and give some order to protect him, surely. But he's got to get the information.
And since I travel around the world meeting with our military, Special Forces, different branches of our military, from Afghanistan to the very far reaches in the southern part of the Philippines, wherever, Iraq--and I won't be going back to Iraq. Prime Minister Maliki didn't like Dana Rohrabacher and me questioning him about repaying some of the U.S. money that we spent to give him the opportunity to be elected, especially since they now have all that oil revenue, and he also didn't like us bringing up the fact that they promised the United States when they took over the government that they would protect the people at Camp Ashraf, the refugees from Iran, and that actually the military had gone in and killed some of those people that he and the U.S. had pledged would be safe. And he didn't like that and apparently sent word that we were not welcome in his country anymore.
We're okay with Americans dying so I can get elected here in Iraq, but we don't want anybody making us keep our promises here in Iraq.
I've seen our military in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, all around the world. I was in the Army for 4 years. And one thing that they are very concerned about that they can't talk about publicly, but especially after we had two former SEALs killed trying to protect the Ambassador, when it wasn't their job to do that, they did it because they're American heroes, American patriots. But our military sees those things.
You know, when I was in the military, President Carter was President. We knew we had a President who did not have our back, who was more concerned about other things than the military. And there was a lot of unrest, but it's a crime in the United States military to say anything derogatory about anyone in your chain of command, including the top person, the President, and it needs to be that way.
When you're in the military, you take orders and you follow your orders, and you don't castigate whoever is up your chain of command, even if they don't have a clue what they're doing. It has to be for the good order and discipline of the military.
But we were not stupid. We knew when the President was not protecting us, was not protecting Americans. We knew when the President was not providing the equipment and what we needed to protect Americans. We knew that.
And as I go around the world and talk to different of our military, they notice that we have officials in this administration who, after Americans dedicated to protecting this country are killed, will come forward from the White House down and say, gee, I had no idea that they were in that kind of trouble. I had no idea that our policies subjected them to being killed. I had no idea. I wish somebody had let me know they were in this kind of trouble.
The military knows that. And as I've mentioned, one soldier in Afghanistan said, please let others in Washington know I don't mind laying down my life for my country, but please don't waste it. That's not much of an ask for those who are committed to protecting the rest of us.
And yet this administration still prevents us from getting to the real facts, the real truth. To have someone come forward and say, I really didn't know there was trouble; I didn't know about the request for help, that does not answer the question that this body is demanding answers to and, that is, well, who did know.
Who made the decisions not to protect Americans in harm's way? Who made that call? Who was it that gave orders, because surely there was somebody out there who said, an American Ambassador is under attack. We're going to go protect him.
To attack a consulate is an act of war under anybody's interpretation of international law. It's an act of war. And when somebody commits an act of war against the United States, against a U.S. Ambassador, against our people, they need to know that there's a Commander in Chief, or if he doesn't know because he's busy, somebody that will give the order to protect those that were put in that bad situation.
Our military needs to know that their Commander cares. Our military needs to know that they're not going to lay down their life for nothing.
This is not the kind of testimony that we need. We want the truth. If this is the truth, so be it.
Of course, we'd heard from her doctors after the fall that, gee, it turns out this could be the kind of thing that would result in memory loss. And I'm glad she's well enough to get along.
My late mother, with a brain tumor, had balance problems. We constantly had to be on the alert for her falling, maybe tripping over a curb and hurting herself. It breaks your heart when you see somebody with bruises from falling. So I'm glad Secretary Clinton's okay.
But we have an Ambassador and other Americans who died. So instead of sending witnesses to say, I don't know what happened, I'll take the blame. I have no clue what happened, but I'm responsible, instead of that, please, Mr. Speaker, we need to be provided with testimony and evidence how did these irresponsible decisions get made, and who made them.
Because, as I say, our military gets it. They see what's going on. Despite some that might say, yeah, if you don't finish high school or don't get an education, you may end up in the military, if you actually spend enough time with the military, instead of being a 90-day wonder and get your Purple Heart and be on your way, if you actually spend substantial time with true military heroes that are dedicated to protecting our way of life, you spend time with them, you know these are smart people.
You spend time with SEALs, as I have, and you find out these are not only incredibly trained people. They're smart people. You spend time with Special Forces, as I have there at Fort Benning where I spent 4 years, that's where the Rangers are trained. They're smart people, and they're smart enough to know when people in their chain of command do not have their back, they do not take actions that make it appear they care.
I know the President cares. I know he does. I know Secretary Clinton cares. But it's not enough to say, ``I had no idea that I put people in harm's way and that they were begging for help and I got them killed.''
You know, let's find out where the problem is. How come they didn't know that was what was going on and the failure to provide security was going to get them killed? Why didn't they know? Those are the kinds of things we need to find out.
Then we find out that there were Americans killed in the attack in Algeria. How could it be that these people in Algeria had the weapons to carry out this attack?
Well, some of the reports indicate that these weapons probably came from Libya. Well, where would the Libyans have gotten weapons? Could it be that those were American-provided weapons, just like this administration forced the sale of guns that would go to kill at least one American and hundreds of Mexicans before it started claiming we've got to go after entirely, with our full force of the law, anybody that sells guns to criminals?
It's a shame they didn't start with the Department of Justice; but I guess if you're the Department of Justice and you're responsible for forcing the sale of guns for criminals, then you're not exactly interested in looking at whose actions in your Department caused the death of hundreds of Mexicans and one or two Americans.
But it needs to be looked at. That's how you avoid mistakes in the future. You find out what caused the mistakes.
The three Americans were among 38 workers killed in the siege of an Algerian gas plant in which Islamic terrorists used hostages as human shields after their attempted mass kidnapping for ransom went awry.
Some Algerian attackers are placed in Benghazi. This story is from Algeria, in The New York Times, dated January 22, by Adam Nossiter:
Several Egyptian members of the squad of militants that lay bloody siege to an Algerian gas complex last week also took part in the deadly attack on the United States mission in Libya in September, a senior Algerian official said Tuesday.
Months and months after a U.S. ambassador was killed, we finally have our FBI director go over to check into it himself. After FBI agents went and did some checking, we had reporters go over there and find actual evidence that somehow the FBI missed or did not bother with. Mistakes that get the United States public servants who have committed their lives to the U.S., and get them killed, requires scrutiny. And this administration, since they will have 4 more years, will, hopefully, be concerned enough about not getting other members of their State Department, their embassies, their consulates, their soldiers, killed for nothing.
Now I know the soldiers. I've been to far too many funerals. And having known so many in harm's way, even if they're sent to the Valley of Death riding with the 600, figuratively speaking, they know they didn't die for nothing. They died devoted to the belief in the things that are set out in the Declaration of Independence--that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights. And just like inheritance, if you're going to keep it, you're probably going to have to fight for it. Again, our military begs, If I'm going to lay down my life for my country, don't waste it.
So, Mr. Speaker, I hope and pray this administration will stop obfuscating, will stop the hiding of documents, preventing us from getting them, so we can find out what mistakes were made so that we can prevent them in the future. And the great news for this administration, Mr. Speaker, is that gee, it doesn't have to run for reelection again. So there should be no excuse whatsoever for not bringing the facts forward.

487,TX.GOHMERT,TX,Gohmert,"Since the President doesn't have to run for reelection, there is no reason not to bring out the facts of Fast and Furious and what happened in Benghazi, that has now spilled over and cost American lives in Algeria. Let's get to the bottom of it. And if Secretary Clinton does not know what happened, if she doesn't have a clue, bless her heart, let's get somebody that does. Let's find out how these mistakes were made so we can prevent future lives being lost when they don't have to be.
Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude today, since this week marks the 40th anniversary of the landmark case of Roe v. Wade, and those of us who have been involved as a lawyer trying cases such as Roe v. Wade, which was a civil case, those of us that have been involved as a judge, as I was also a chief justice, we know that in order for a case to be ripe, that it can be heard in court, there must be a justiciable issue, as there was in Roe v. Wade. But the person bringing the case actually has standing to bring the case. It took years, but we ultimately find out that at the time there was no standing. We find out from the person who was Roe, a fictitious name, that she deeply regrets what had happened. And that case has been responsible for the killing of millions of lives.
I have so many dear friends on the Democratic side of the aisle. I know their hearts. They don't want people to get killed. They care about life. And so many on both sides of the aisle talk about trying to protect ``the most vulnerable among us.'' I would humbly submit there is no one more vulnerable than an unborn child. There is that cord through which nourishment and oxygen flow as that baby grows and develops. There is a desire in the human heart to live. There is a desire to live. And those precious, innocent children want to live. It's who they are. It's part of their genetic makeup to want to live. There's no baby, born or unborn, who is capable mentally or physically of taking their own lives intentionally. It can't happen. It doesn't happen. They want to live.
So our heart breaks as a Nation, thinking about the spilled blood of innocent, vulnerable children all put to death because someone did not understand what was going on and they were led to believe it's not a life, it's a choice. The children want to live. When our first-born was born, she came 8 to 10 weeks prematurely. Back then, it was uncertain whether she was going to live. We were encouraged at first, but the doctor said, She's in trouble. Her lungs were not developed. And I knew from cases that I had been involved in that if too much oxygen is given to a preemie, there's a chance they'll go blind. So doctors avoided that, if at all possible. And I saw them go from 20 to 40 to 60 to 80 to 100 percent oxygen. When they got to 100 percent, I knew Katy was in big trouble or they wouldn't risk her blindness.
They said we needed to ship her to either Dallas or Shreveport, where she could get the top-rated neonatal ICU. Shreveport was a little closer. I was torn--my wife was suffering, having given birth prematurely--whether to stay with her or go with the baby. She said, Go with Katy. Do anything you can to help her. So I followed the ambulance to Shreveport. A man named Dr. Tsing was the neonatologist. He cared so deeply for those babies. And I began to understand why the doctor said they seemed to have the best survival rate there in Shreveport.
He had a policy that if you went by a child, you had to observe proper sanitization procedures, but you touched those children, you talked to those children. They hear you. They know you.
When I got there, they sat me on a stool and said you can stay no more than 2 hours, but talk to this child, she knows your voice. She has heard your voice for maybe 7 months. She knows your voice. Talk to her. Caress her arms. Talk to her. Caress her little face. And I did. The monitors were going so fast, so erratic was the heart rate, so erratic was the breathing, the lungs so undeveloped.
As I had been there for a couple of hours, Dr. Tsing came back over. Katie had a grip on my finger, that tiny little hand of hers around the very end of my finger, and she wouldn't let go. He came over after a while and he said, have you looked at the monitors? I looked up. She still had such undeveloped lungs, but her breathing had stabilized. Her heart rate had stabilized. And Dr. Tsing said, she is drawing life, she is drawing strength from you. I couldn't leave. I sat there for 8 hours before they forced me to take a break, but I learned, born or unborn, a child wants to live.
I hope and pray we will not continue to allow the killing of 40, 50, 60 million more precious babies like Katie. Katie is alive today. She is a joy, she is brilliant. There are other children that wanted to live as well. We need to stop deceiving pregnant women that it's not a life. It is a life, and it's endowed by our Creator.

488,AZ.FRANKS,AZ,Franks,"Mr. Speaker, I know that another legislative day has come to an end and that sunset fast approaches in Washington, 
I stand before this House with what I call a Sunset Memorial. Because, you see, Mr. Speaker, before the sun sets today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children will be killed by abortion on demand in the land of the free and the home of the brave. That is more than the number of innocent lives lost on September 11th in this country, and it happens every single day.
Mr. Speaker, it has now been 40 years--an entire generation--since the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 55 million of its own unborn children. Some of them, Mr. Speaker, cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air, we couldn't hear them.
All of them had at least four things in common, Mr. Speaker. First, they were just nameless little babies who had done wrong to no one, and yet each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each one of their mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never be quite the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity in this world are now lost forever.
Yet, even in the glare of such tragedy, this generation still clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself over and over again and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims, those yet unborn.
Mr. Speaker, I recently heard Barack Obama speak such poignant words that, whether he knows it or not, apply so profoundly to the tragedy of abortion on demand in America. Let me quote selected, excerpted portions of his comments.
He said:
This is our first task--caring for our children. It's our first job. If we don't get that right, we don't get anything right. That's how, as a society, we will be judged. And by that measure, can we truly say, as a Nation, that we are meeting our obligations? Can we honestly say that we're doing enough to keep our children--all of them--safe from harm?
He went on to quote:
Can we say that we're truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose?
He said:
I've been reflecting on this the last few days, and if we're honest with ourselves, the answer is no. We're not doing enough. And we will have to change.
Oh, Mr. Speaker, how true the President's words were. The President also said:
We can't tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change.
Then the President asked:
Are we really prepared to say that we're powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard? Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom?
What a powerful question, Mr. Speaker. It is the most relevant question we should all be asking in the midst of this genocidal murder of thousands of unborn children in America every day.
The President said:
Our journey is not complete until all our children are cared for and cherished and always safe from harm.
He said:
That is our generation's task--to make these words, these rights, these values of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness real for every American.
Mr. Speaker, never have I so deeply agreed with any words ever spoken by President Obama as those I have just quoted. And yet this President, in the most merciless distortion of logic and reason and humanity itself, refuses to apply these majestic words to the helpless unborn babies of this Nation. How I wish that somehow Mr. Obama would just open his heart and his ears to his own words, and ask himself in the core of his soul, why his words, that should apply to all children, cannot include the most helpless of all children.
Only a few days ago, no more than 200 yards from this well, Barack Obama put his hand down on the same Bible that Abraham Lincoln was sworn in on when he took his Presidential oath.
Mr. Speaker, we should remember that we honor Abraham Lincoln most because he found the courage as President of the United States in the days of slavery, and the humanity within himself, to recognize the image of God stamped on the soul of slaves that the Supreme Court said were not human and that the tide of public opinion didn't recognize as protectable under the law. Could it still be, could it still be, Mr. Speaker, that President Barack Obama might consider that perspective, as well as his own legacy, and even eternity itself, Mr. Speaker, and recognize that in his day under his Presidency that these little unborn children look so desperately to him now for help?
Could it be that the President might finally remember that on the pages of the Bible on which he laid his hand were the words written in red:
Inasmuch as you have done unto the least of these My brethren, you have done it unto Me.
Mr. Speaker, whether he does or not, it is certainly time for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said:
The care of human life and happiness, and not its destruction, is the chief and only object of good government.
The phrase in the 14th Amendment encapsulates our entire Constitution. It says:
No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.
Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of all Americans and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. The bedrock foundation of this Republic is that clarion declaration of that self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights, the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core self-evident truth. It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world, Mr. Speaker. It is who we are. And yet today another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We have failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent little American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them.
So, Mr. Speaker, let me conclude this sunset memorial in the hopes that perhaps someone new who heard it tonight will finally embrace the very inconvenient truth that abortion really does kill little babies and that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never imagine, and that it is time we stood up together again and looked to our Declaration of Independence and remember that we are the same America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust, and we are still the courageous and compassionate Nation that can find a better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand.
It is still not too late for us to make a better world and for America to be the one that leads the rest of the planet, just as we did in the days of slavery, from this tragic genocide of murdering nearly 4,000 of our own children every day.
So, now, Mr. Speaker, as we consider the plight of the unborn after 40 years under Roe v. Wade, maybe we can remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are all numbered, and that all too soon, each one of us will also walk from these Chambers for the very last time. And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day, may that be the day when we finally find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect these, the least of our tiny little brothers and sisters in America, from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand.
Mr. Speaker, it is now 40 years since Roe v. Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children. This, in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

490,NV.REID,NV,Reid,"Madam President, yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with my Democratic Senate caucus for the first time this year. It was the first opportunity for all of us to sit down together, to break bread, and to discuss challenges and opportunities we all face. As the majority leader, I was gratified to see so many new faces and to have such an inclusive caucus. It was music to my ears to hear the announcement that the Presiding Officer today would be Heidi Heitkamp.
We have nine new Democratic Senators. Four of these new Senators are women, and so about one-third of our Democratic caucus is now women. We have, for example, the first Asian woman. We have expanded our majority. I am particularly satisfied that with each passing election cycle our caucus better reflects the Nation it serves. But despite the diversity of the caucus--and in particular its freshmen--there is one quality shared by each Democratic Senator: deep and abiding patriotism.
As Governor Adlai Stevenson said:
Patriotism is not short, frenzied outbursts of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime.
That is true. Patriotism is not short, frenzied outbursts of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime. If we look at the records, the careers of these new Senators, that is the way it is.
Each person coming here reminds me of my first few weeks in the House of Representatives when Tip O'Neill--we had a large incoming class, so he called us in these groups of maybe 15 or so, and he told us something I have always remembered. He said: Each of you are successful politicians or you wouldn't be here. And that is true. I say that to each of my new Senators. They are successful politicians, and there is nothing wrong with the word ``politician.'' I am proud I am a politician. I am proud I serve in government, and we should each be proud.
So I am pleased now, and I was pleased yesterday, to be surrounded by so many dedicated public servants, new Members and old alike, who have devoted their lives to making their individual States and our shared Nation a better place in which to grow up, grow a family, and grow old.
Each new Democratic Member is accomplished, I repeat, in his or her own right. Our new caucus members include a couple of former Governors, a Harvard law professor, an engineer, just to name a few. While they have each accomplished so much already, their greatest achievements are still ahead of them. I know they will look back with satisfaction on the work we do together in the Senate.
Our caucus, this Congress, and our country face immense challenges. As we approach these tests and trials, this diverse group of new Democratic Senators will be united by a single objective: to fight for fairness and balance on behalf of the middle class. Senate Rules Reform
We are going to continue to work on Senate rules reforms. I will continue to work with the Republican leader on a package of reforms I hope we can agree on. As I have said before, if we don't agree, then we are going to do something as a Democratic caucus alone. I remain cautiously optimistic we will be able to move forward on a bipartisan basis. I hope we can do that. I will have more to say about that if, in fact, we can do that.
We are not going to get everything we want, and the Republicans aren't going to get everything they want. But maybe we can find a sweet spot in the middle and come up with something that will make the Senate more efficient. However, Democrats reserve the right of all Senators to propose changes to the Senate rules. We will explicitly not acquiesce in the carrying over of all the rules from last Congress. There must be some agreement reached or we will have to use every means to make the Congress--especially the Senate--more efficient.

493,IN.COATS,IN,Coats,"Madam President, earlier this week, through the eyes of the Nation watched the inauguration ceremony here in Washington. A week before that, back in Indiana, I was present for the celebration of the inauguration of Indiana's 50th Governor, former Congressman Mike Pence, who is taking over after 8 years of leadership under our former Governor, Mitch Daniels. So back-to-back weekends had two special events.
Inauguration ceremonies are a time for reflection on what has happened in the past and a time for new vision on how we ought to go forward with the future. It is also a time for new opportunity. An opportunity for the kind of change necessary to address the problems and challenges we face.
As I participated in the inauguration events for Governor Pence in Indianapolis just two weekends ago, I couldn't help but think of the remarkable record of achievement and the bold reforms that our former Governor, Mitch Daniels, delivered to the Hoosier State and the lessons they may offer to Washington.
In 2005, Indiana faced a several-hundred-million-dollar deficit. This pales by comparison to the deficit we face here; but, nevertheless, for a State of our size it is a significant amount. Although it is constitutionally mandated in Indiana, we had not balanced our budget for 7 years. Governor Daniels and his team had a vision and the political courage to make much needed changes, and the people of Indiana supported and responded. While other States increased spending and raised taxes, Indiana reduced spending, cut taxes, and paid down our debts.
Governor Daniels, with the help of the legislature and with the support of the people of Indiana, slowed down the rate of spending. The State's expenditures have grown at less than one-quarter the rate of the previous decade. We also reduced the size of State government.
Indiana has the fewest State employees per capita in the country. We paid down the previous debt by 43 percent, and we currently sit with a budget surplus and a rebate program which will give money collected in taxes back to the taxpayer because of our state's efficiency and effectiveness in terms of running our government. Indiana, as a result of this, has received its first AAA credit rating. This means when we do need to borrow or sell bonds to do certain infrastructure or meet other needs, we can receive low interest rates because of our superb AAA rating. All this has transformed Indiana's balance sheet and made our State one of the most attractive places to live, raise a family, and do business in the Midwest, if not in the Nation.
The story of Indiana and how it got hold of its fiscal issues has been written up in national journals and newspapers and documentaries and others. It is a remarkable story. It is not unique because we see these things happening in other States around the country led not only by Republican Governors but Democrat Governors. These are the kinds of decisions that have to be made and are being made to restore state and local governments. And it has created a much brighter future for the citizens of those States.
Governor Daniels has often said, ``You'd be amazed by how much government you'll never miss.'' The results of his administration back that up.
You can go around Indiana, as I have, and talk to people from big cities to small, rural to urban and everything in between and ask them how we have moved from deficit to surplus in our state. You can ask if they still believe our state performs the necessary functions of government and you can ask Hoosiers what has been cut that you think should have stayed.
Frankly, no one could come up with an answer that says: We have had disastrous consequences from these decisions. The vast majority say that things are working pretty well. In fact, I can get my license renewed through a total revamp of our licensing system in just a few minutes over the Internet or just a few minutes at the DMV. Governor Daniels' measure for that was in and out in less than 7 minutes.
For those of us who have spent hours and hours committing half a day or more to getting our license renewed, this is a remarkable achievement. The use of technology, privatization, and the use of more efficient government demands that our civil servants do more with less and this has proven to be effective.
While the fiscal situation we faced in Indiana is not totally analogous to what we face here, the principles are the same, and there still are many similarities. As Washington seeks answers at the start of this new session of Congress on how we move forward and address our extremely serious debt situation and get our fiscal house back in order so that we too can retain a AAA rating and so we too can provide the opportunity for growth and opportunity not just for the middle class but for all Americans in the future, maybe there are some lessons to be learned from Indiana. The spend less, borrow less, and tax less Hoosier model has resulted in balanced budgets, job creation, and a AAA credit rating. In contrast, the spend more, borrow more, and tax more approach in Washington during these last several years has resulted in fewer jobs, higher debt, and a threatened downgrade from credit agencies.
So as we reflect back on the last 4 years of this current administration, it is clear to me we must take a different course in the second term of this administration.
Whether lawmakers want to admit it, the crux of our problem is this: Washington has promised Americans far too much and committed well beyond our means. Federal spending and borrowing cannot continue at this current pace without dire consequences.
Whether one is reading or listening to a liberal, conservative or a nonpartisan economist or an analyst, there is a consensus that sustaining our current rate or continuing our rate of borrowing and spending simply is not feasible and the consequences will be dire if we do not address it.
As we seek to address these issues, my suggestion for Washington is to take a look at the Hoosier model. It is tested, it is proven, and it is working.
We need to go big and bold. We need to have the political courage to look beyond the short-term political consequences, as we perceive them, to the long-term benefit from sound policies--which, interestingly enough, translate into good politics. Strengthening the economy and getting our country on a track to brighter and more prosperous times should be our priority.
We have proven in Indiana that good policy, no matter how politically difficult it might seem at the time to achieve, does translate into good politics. But much more important than the politics, good policy can translate into strengthening our economy, improving the lives of Americans, and providing opportunity for future generations.
It is time we learn that lesson in Washington that our State of Indiana and many States across the country, as well as other communities, are learning. It is time we exhibit the political courage to stand and do what I think just about everyone in this body understands; that is, to get a hold of runaway spending and borrowing that is putting us in a very deep fiscal hole and will have significant, dire consequences not only on future generations but even our current generation.
The time is now. As I said from this spot yesterday, 2013 is the decisive year. In 2014, we will be back into an election year, and that tired old belief that we cannot make these kinds of changes with the election looming will surface again. If we don't act now, more people will say that we need to wait until after the next election. It will push us into 2015. Many who have looked at our situation fiscally and analyzed it from a nonpartisan, nonideological basis have said 2015 is too late.
This is the time when we need to summon our courage, summon our political will, and do what is right for the American people. We cannot continue to bump along at less than 2 percent growth. We cannot continue to keep more than 8 percent or nearly 8 percent of our people unemployed; and, obviously, that number is much higher when we count those who are no longer looking for work who have given up. We cannot continue to keep America on the edge of uncertainty in terms of what our fiscal future will look like.
Let us summon that courage to go forward. Let us use examples from those States, the support of those Governors and the support they have received from people across those States. Let us summon the courage to do what we need to do.
I want to continue talking about how we need to address this with a ``go big, go bold'' type of approach. Everyone says and concludes that if we can put that package together to address our long-term ills over a period of time and bring us back to balance and stability, we will see a revival of the economy of this country and we will see great hope for the American people going forward.

499,KY.MCCONNELL,KY,McConnell,"Madam President, President Obama may have been vague on details in his inaugural speech on Monday, but I will give him this, he couldn't have been clearer about the tone and the direction he has in mind for the second term. Gone is the postpartisan rhetoric that propelled him onto the national stage and into the White House. In its place is an unabashedly leftwing appeal for more bureaucratic control and centralized power here in Washington.
On Monday, we saw a President and a party that appeared to have shifted into reverse and jammed on the gas. For Democrats in the Obama age, the era of big government being over is officially over. And anybody who disagrees with their approach isn't just wrong, they are not just standing in the way of progress, they are malevolent, they are the bad guys, they are the ones who want to take food away from children, they want the old and the infirm to suffer, they want to choose between caring for the people who built this country, as the President put it on Monday, and investing in those who will build our future.
I don't know if the President buys all this stuff; I don't know if he believes his own caricature--I certainly hope not--but one thing I do know is that questioning the intentions of one's political opponents makes it awfully hard to get anything done in a representative democracy. As the President himself said, without so much as a hint of irony, we cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name calling as reasoned debate.
The President won the election. I congratulate him on his victory. It is his prerogative to lay out an agenda and to make an argument--against all evidence--for the efficacy of big government, more Washington spending, and centralization. It is even his prerogative to argue--mistakenly, in my view--that America's greatness somehow rests not on its communities and voluntary associations, its churches and charities, on civil society, but instead on the dictates of Washington. But to suggest that those of us and our constituents who believe otherwise don't want the best interest of our parents or our children or our country's future is, at best, needlessly provocative; at worst, it suggests a troubling inability to view those who don't happen to share your opinions as beneath you.
To suggest, as one of the President's spokesmen did earlier this week, that both the American political system and those who belong to the party of Lincoln aren't worthy of this White House or its agenda isn't the way to get things done. It makes it impossible to tend to problems we simply have to face up to and that we will only solve together. Frankly, it calls into question the President's own belief in the wisdom and the efficacy of the constitutional system of checks and balances that the Founders so wisely put in place.
The postinaugural period is usually a chance to pivot to governing after a long campaign. It is an opportunity for Presidents to reach out to the minority and to forge compromises. But that is not what we are seeing this time around. Even before Monday we all noted the harsh change in tone, the reboot of the campaign machine, and how, instead of offering an olive branch to those who disagree with him, the President had already decided to transform his campaign operation into a weapon to bulldoze anyone who doesn't share his vision. Well, I would suggest that one thing the American people don't want is a permanent campaign. That is the last thing the American people are looking for--a permanent campaign. They want us to work together on solutions to our problems. And deficits and debt are right at the top of the list.
I wish to suggest this morning the President rethink the adversarial tone he has adopted in recent weeks. Our problems are simply too urgent and too big for the President to give up on working with us. I appeal to him once again to work with us on the things we can achieve together, and let us start with the deficit and the debt. Because the only way we will be able to tackle these problems is by doing it together. If he refuses, if he insists on spending the next 4 years pushing a polarizing hard-left agenda instead, I assure him he will meet a determined opposition not only from Republicans in Washington but from the very people he seems to believe are squarely on his side in the push to remake government in his image.
The irony in the President's attacks, of course, is that the kind of reforms Republicans are calling for are the only conceivable route to saving the programs the President claims he wants to protect. Failing to reform the entitlement programs of the last century now--right now--is the best way to guarantee they no longer exist in their current form. I mean, one could practically hear the ring of the cash register with every new promise the President made. At a time when we can all see the failure of such policies by simply turning on the news, he seems blissfully--blissfully--unaware of the fact that from Athens to Madrid the sad, slow death of the left's big government dream is on display for all to see. If we want a less prosperous, less dynamic, less mobile society, that is the way to go--just ``Europeanize'' America.
The President's vision of an all-powerful government that rights every wrong and heals every wound may warm the liberal heart, but it is completely divorced from experience and from reality. So today I wish to do my part to bring the President and his allies in Congress a little closer down to Earth. I know it may be hard for them to accept, but the reality is this: We have a spending problem--not a taxing problem, a spending problem.
Let's take a look at the chart to my right. The green represents historic and projected tax revenue. And we can see it goes right straight across here out to 2040. The tax increases of 3 weeks ago were delivered by operation of law. In other words, the law expired and all of the Bush tax cuts were over. The Congress, 2 hours after everybody's taxes went up--in other words, after all the Bush tax cuts expired--restored tax relief for 99 percent of the American people, and they did it on a permanent basis to guarantee we wouldn't have another cliff, as we inevitably have. When a law sunsets, we have a cliff.
So the President was able to get some new revenue by operation of law, and that represents this dark blue line right across here. You can see that is pretty steady out to 2040.
The President, of course, said that wasn't nearly enough. He said: We need more taxes, and we will be back asking for more taxes later. So as nearly as we can tell, based on what he has said, the taxes he would like to add to the ones he got by operation of law 2\1/2\ weeks ago is this light blue line right across here.
If the President were given all the tax increases he says at the moment he wants, that would provide this amount of revenue going out to 2040. As you can see, that doesn't do anything to solve the problem because the red represents spending in the past and the spending escalation that will occur if we don't do anything to solve the spending problem.
Look at this line dramatically going up to 2040. So as you can see, there is not enough revenue we can raise without completely shutting down the economy to solve the problem. In fact, it produces a rather static and totally insignificant amount of revenue in order to deal with the massive spending problem.
So this constant demand for more and more tax increases on, I guess, whom people assume is the more successful guy down the street may be a great campaign tactic, but it doesn't do anything to solve the problem. Even if the President were able to get every bit of taxes he wants, we still have an enormous gap in spending if we don't deal with the real problem, which is spending. We have a spending addiction. I didn't make this up. This is a fact. This is reality.
So the tax issue is over. Congress has restored permanent tax relief for 99 percent of the American people. Even if the President were to get--and he will not--any more tax revenue, it is perfectly obvious that doesn't do anything to solve the problem.
So the challenge for us--and looking at the chart we can see--is revenue today is just about where it has been for the past 30 years or so. The President spent nearly his entire first term arguing that we needed to tax the so-called rich to solve our fiscal woes. He harangued Congress about it. He argued for it in rallies and debates. He threatened to push us over the cliff if he didn't get his way.
In the end, by operation of law he got part of what he asked for. And the reason he got it, as I said earlier, is because the tax relief we passed in 2001 and 2003 carried an expiration date. President Obama got some of the tax increases he wanted because the law expired. Then Congress, led by Republicans, voted to make Bush-era tax rates permanent for 99 percent of all Americans. Now, permanency is important. It has been kind of lost on the general public, but the importance is we don't have another cliff, another expiration date where all of a sudden everything changes.
Given how much time he devoted to that one topic, one would think his tax hike would have closed the deficit, eliminated the entire national debt, and left us with extra cash to spare. But do you see that tiny little blue line I pointed to right here? That is how much additional revenue he got. This blue area is the revenue he says he wants. He will not get it; but if he did, it is pretty apparent it has nothing whatsoever to do with solving the spending addiction.
So if this revenue doesn't come anywhere close to solving the problem, the real challenge, obviously, is how we are going to control all of this red. What do we do about this? Well, we are clearly spending way more than we take in. The real uptick, interestingly enough, occurs about the time the President took office. It has been hard enough to find ways to close the President's trillion-dollar deficits. But as I just pointed out, they are nothing next to what is going to hit us when tens of millions of baby boomers reach retirement age--nothing compared to what is heading our way.
I pointed out the massive slope. That is what is headed our way. Nothing short of a bipartisan effort is going to fix this problem, and there is only one way we can do it. We can't tax our way out of this problem. The revenue question is behind us. The law we voted for, as I said, made current tax rates permanent. I am pretty confident not a single Republican in the House or Senate will vote to raise any more taxes. But even if we were to do that, all the taxes the President asked for would only put us here in 2040. And look at what would be spent.
So the reality the President needs to face--and quickly--is that there is no realistic way to raise taxes high enough to even begin to address this problem. That is why Republicans are saying we need to start controlling spending, and we need to do it now. That is why if the President wants to do something good right now, he should put us out of the liberal wish list and put us out of the character attacks and join us in this great task. It is the transcendent issue of our time.
If we don't fix this problem, we don't leave behind for our children and grandchildren the kind of America our parents left behind for us. There is no bigger issue, even though it got scant mention in the State of the Union.
Now, I have no animus toward the President. I just want to see him do something about the problem because the longer we wait, the worse the problem becomes. The more we delay the inevitable, the less time younger Americans will have to plan for the reforms we make today. That is simply not right.
So the President has a choice. He can paint himself as a warrior of the left and charge into battle with failed ideas we have already tried before; he can demean and blame the opposition for his own failure to lead; he can indulge his supporters in a bitter, never-ending campaign that will only divide our country further; or he could take the responsible road. He can help his own base come to terms with the mathematical reality.
Some people over there are living in a fantasy world--a world that doesn't exist. He could reach out to leaders in both parties--and all of the members in both parties--and negotiate in good faith. We would be happy to give him credit. That is fine by me. If boosting his legacy is what it takes and it helps the country, that is all the better.
If my constituents believe they are working to help make their future a little better and a little brighter, great. But we can't waste any more time denying the reality that is staring each of us in the face. There is only one way to solve this problem, and that is to do something about this spending addiction that is going to sink this country and turn us into Greece.
Senate Republicans are ready to help the President solve this problem. I hope we have an opportunity to do so.

502,TN.ALEXANDER,TN,Alexander,"I want to congratulate the Republican leader for his remarks.
Here is my question. We have arrived at a time when we have a newly elected President who has had a fine inaugural day. He has an agenda that he wants to follow which he announced in his inaugural address. It is not an agenda that most of us on this side agree with, but he has an agenda that he wants to follow in his second term, all of which would ensure--in his eyes--his legacy as a President.
But isn't there one thing that in order to get to that agenda--or any other thing--he and we have to do, and that is to address the debt? Isn't the very best time--isn't the very best time to do something difficult, something nobody wants to talk about, something that is hard--the best time to do that is at a time when we have a divided government, a Democratic President, a Republican House, and 30 or 40 or 50 of us Senators on both sides of the aisle who have been saying for 2 years that we are ready to fix the debt?
Isn't this an opportunity now? Not just because it is a divided government, but because the House of Representatives today may very well create a 2-month or 3-month window during which we can address all of these issues if we had Presidential leadership?",TN,ALEXANDER,0.37,R,want congratul republican leader remark question arriv time newli elect presid fine inaugur day agenda want follow announc inaugur address agenda us side agre agenda want follow second term would ensurein eyeshi legaci presid isnt one thing order get agendaor thingh address debt isnt best timeisnt best time someth difficult someth nobodi want talk someth hardth best time time divid govern democrat presid republican hous 30 40 50 us senat side aisl say 2 year readi fix debt isnt opportun divid govern hous repres today may well creat 2month 3month window address issu presidenti leadership
503,KY.MCCONNELL,KY,McConnell,"I say to my friend from Tennessee, it is counterintuitive. But one could argue that a divided government--which we have had more often than not since World War II--has produced four of the most significant accomplishments for our country in modern times.
In the Reagan administration, President Reagan and Tip O'Neill, the Democratic Speaker of the House, agreed to raise the age for Social Security to save Social Security for another generation. Reagan and Tip O'Neill did the last comprehensive tax reform.
Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress did welfare reform, arguably the most important piece of social legislation in recent times. And Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress actually balanced the budgets in the late 1990s.
My friend from Tennessee is correct. Divided government actually is the perfect time--some would argue even the only time--we can do tough things, hard-to-explain things that need to be done to save the country. So I hate to miss the opportunity presented by a divided government to tackle the transcendent issue of our times.

504,TN.ALEXANDER,TN,Alexander,"Madam President, I wonder if I might pose one more question to the Republican leader after making a short statement.
I came to this body as a young lawyer-legislative aide to Senator Howard Baker a long time ago, in 1967. I remember very well Senator Baker's story about how the civil rights bill of 1968 was passed. I have discussed this with the Republican leader before. He knows that era as well or better than I do.
But there was a time when Senator Baker said he was in Everett Dirksen's office--he is the man who had the job that Senator McConnell now has. He was the Republican leader then. He said he heard the telephone ring. He heard only one end of the conversation, but Senator Dirksen was saying: No, Mr. President, I cannot come down and have a drink with you tonight. I did that last night, and Luella is very unhappy with me. And that was the conversation.
About 30 minutes later there was a rustle out in the outer office of the Republican leader's office--the very office that Senator McConnell now holds. Two beagles, followed by the President of the United States, came in. Lyndon Johnson, the President, said to the Republican leader: Everett, if you won't have a drink with me, I am down here to have one with you. And they disappeared in the back room for 45 minutes.
The point of all that is not their socializing. The point was it was in that very office, the Republican leader's office, that in 1968, the next year, the civil rights bill was written and enacted. Lyndon Johnson got the credit for that in history but Everett Dirksen made it possible, and there were at that time many more Democrats in the Senate than Republicans.
What I want to say to Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, the question I want to ask him, is this. He has seen the U.S. Senate and Presidency for the last number of years. He has seen many relationships between the President and leaders of the opposite party. He knows how this place works. My sense of the Republican leader and of the large majority of us is that we wish to see a result. We wish to see a result on this very tough issue of saving Social Security, saving Medicare, saving Medicaid, saving these programs on which seniors depend. I wonder if the Republican leader would agree with me that despite the fact that we engage every day in political matters, that we have big differences of opinion, that on this issue, without Presidential leadership, we cannot get a result and that there are a lot of us on both sides of the aisle who are ready to work with the President to fix the debt?",TN,ALEXANDER,0.37,R,madam presid wonder might pose one question republican leader make short statement came bodi young lawyerlegisl aid senat howard baker long time ago 1967 rememb well senat baker stori civil right bill 1968 pass discuss republican leader know era well better time senat baker said everett dirksen officeh man job senat mcconnel republican leader said heard telephon ring heard one end convers senat dirksen say mr presid cannot come drink tonight last night luella unhappi convers 30 minut later rustl outer offic republican leader officeth offic senat mcconnel hold two beagl follow presid unit state came lyndon johnson presid said republican leader everett wont drink one disappear back room 45 minut point social point offic republican leader offic 1968 next year civil right bill written enact lyndon johnson got credit histori everett dirksen made possibl time mani democrat senat republican want say senat mcconnel republican leader question want ask seen u senat presid last number year seen mani relationship presid leader opposit parti know place work sens republican leader larg major us wish see result wish see result tough issu save social secur save medicar save medicaid save program senior depend wonder republican leader would agre despit fact engag everi day polit matter big differ opinion issu without presidenti leadership cannot get result lot us side aisl readi work presid fix debt

The only way to get an outcome on the biggest issue of our time is with Presidential leadership. So it was disappointing to see scant reference in the State of the Union. Of course that is just one speech and I have not given up hoping that this President can make solving the transcendent issue of our time one of his premier accomplishments.

506,TN.ALEXANDER,TN,Alexander,"I thank the Senator from Kentucky for extending his time on the floor. On my own I wish to continue that line of thinking a little bit.
It is traditional that when we have a new President, a newly inaugurated President, that he has a pretty good opportunity to get what he asks; that it is a time of maximum leverage, it is a time to do important things, it is a time to do difficult things, it is a time to do things that otherwise might not get done.
Presidents are defined by their skills--their communication skills, their electoral ability--but they are also defined by their capacity over a period of years to identify the hard issues that are important to our country and cause people, as the President said in his address day before yesterday, to work together to solve those problems. Now the problem is whether you want to raise taxes on the guy down the street with the biggest house. That is not so hard to do. The problem is to spend money that you do not have--because you can do it; that is not so hard to do. If the problem is to address a disaster to help people who are in desperate shape, there might be some debate about whether it is really a disaster or not but it is not hard to do because in the end it is going to happen. What Presidents are remembered for is dealing with important, difficult crises.
President Clinton is remembered for a number of things but one of the things he did was challenge the conventional thinking in his own party to deal with welfare reform. It would not have happened if he had not done it. It would not have happened if he had not done it because a Republican could not have made the argument. A President's job, according to George Reedy, the former press secretary to Lyndon Johnson, is three things: One is to see an urgent need, two is to develop a strategy to meet the need, and the third is to persuade at least half the people he is right.
President Nixon in the early 1960s went to China. That seems like ancient history but that was straight against the core of the Republican Party at that time. That was something that was inconceivable for a Republican President to do, given the history of mainland China and Taiwan, as they were both called.
There have been many times in our history when Presidents have had to do the hard work. President George H.W. Bush made a budget agreement which may have caused him to lose the election in 1992 because it angered a number of Republicans. But it also helped balance the budget and gave us a period of time in the 1990s when that budget agreement plus a good economy gave us an actual surplus of funding.
I sense that there is at the White House a feeling, two things I wish to disabuse the White House of. The first is that the budget problem is not a real problem. I cannot believe people at the White House think that. Everybody knows it is. Senator McConnell gave a very good explanation of what was going on there. But let me say it this way: In 2025, according to the Congressional Budget Office, every dollar of taxes we collect will go to pay for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and interest on the debt, and there is nothing left for national defense, National Laboratories, Pell grants for education, highways, or the investments that we need to make in research to grow this country. It all goes for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and the interest on debt, every single penny we collect. And that is only 12 years away. That is not me talking. That is the Congressional Budget Office saying that. The Medicare trustees have said that in 2024 the Medicare Program will not have enough money to pay all of its bills. Whose bills? Bills of seniors, bills of Tennesseans, many of whom are literally counting the days until they are old enough to be eligible for Medicare so they can pay their medical bills. It would be a tragedy if that day arrived and there were not enough money to pay the bills. But the Medicare trustees, who by law are supposed to tell us these things, say that day will come in 2024. It is just 11 years away and that is the day for people already on Medicare and people who are going to be on Medicare.
Medicaid, which is a program for lower income Americans, is an important program. As Governor, I dealt with it in my State. But when I was Governor, it was 8 percent of the State budget. Today it is 26 percent of the State budget. It is soaking up almost every dollar that would go to higher education. As a result, students around the country are wondering: Why are my tuition fees going up? It is because of Washington's Medicaid Program requiring States to make decisions that soak up money that otherwise would be used to fund education.
In our State of Tennessee, 30 years ago the State paid 70 percent of the cost of going to the University of Tennessee. Today it pays 30. And Medicaid is the chief culprit.
Everyone knows this. The President's own debt commission has told him this and suggested a way to deal with it. Forty or fifty of us on both sides of the aisle have been working together, meeting together, having dinner together, writing bills together, trying to come up with plans to do it. Senator Corker, my colleague from Tennessee, has developed a bill on which I am his prime cosponsor which says we have found a way to strengthen Medicare and other entitlements by reducing the growth in spending. We understand this.
We passed a Budget Control Act a couple of years ago. People said they didn't like it. It was not so bad because it took 38 percent of the budget, which is all of our discretionary spending--including national defense, national parks, national labs--and said it will go up at about the rate of inflation. This is before we get to the so-called sequester. But what about the rest of the budget? That is the automatic stuff we do not even vote on: Medicare, entitlements, all this? It is going up at about three to four times the rate of inflation. It is going to bankrupt these programs. Seniors will not be able to have their medical bills paid and the country will be bankrupt. That is no overstatement. The former Comptroller of the Currency says that. President Clinton says this is an urgent problem. The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says the national debt is the single biggest threat to our national security. Why are we not dealing with it? I think we are not dealing with it, A, because it is hard to do; B, because on both sides of the aisle we have not been effective in dealing with it before.
I remember when we had an all-Republican cast of characters here in town--President Bush, a Republican majority--we tried to reduce the growth of Medicare and we could not get the votes to do that.
This is not easy to do, but Robert Merry, who wrote a book about President Polk, had lunch with some of us yesterday, made this statement: ``In America's history every crisis has been solved by Presidential leadership or not at all.''
Whether it was Lincoln in the Civil War or Reagan and Tip O'Neill or Nixon to China or Clinton on welfare reform--we can all identify the crises. But it takes Presidential leadership to do it. It takes that to do it.
I was a Governor, which is much smaller potatoes. If I sat around waiting for the State legislature, with all respect, to come up with a road program we would still be driving on dirt roads. They were waiting for the Governor to do it. That is how our system works.
I wonder if the President thinks that the debt is not a problem? I cannot imagine anybody at the White House thinks that. This is a problem. If the President does not address it during his two terms he will be remembered by history as failing to do that. His legacy may be a failure to address financial matters that put this country on a road to bankruptcy. Or, if he were to do it, if he were to provide the leadership, he would be--as the Australian Foreign Minister has said, ``America is one budget agreement away from reasserting its global preeminence.'' Why wouldn't President Obama want to be known as the President who caused America to reassert its global preeminence by dealing with a budget agreement during the first 3 months of his term and then he can get on with his agenda, about which we can argue? That leaves me with only one thought: That the President thinks we don't want to do it. We do want to do it and it is a misunderstanding if he thinks that.
I know the Republican leader would not mind me saying he is a wily, clever tactician who knows the Senate as well as anyone here. But if you look carefully, when we got down to the last few days of the year and needed an agreement on taxes, the Republican leader was in the middle of the agreement. When we needed an agreement to try to avoid default on the debt, the Republican leader was the one who was in the middle of doing that.
I think if the White House thinks that the Republican leader or we on the Republican side do not want to fix the debt, they are badly misunderstanding where we are and who we are. I do not know how we can say it more clearly. We have written bills that do it. We have held dinners to talk about it. We have made public statements with Democrats, 30 or 40 of us at a time, saying we support Simpson-Bowles, we support Domenici-Rivlin, or we support this or we support that. What is missing? Two words: Presidential leadership. This is not a partisan comment. It just does not work unless the President lays out his plan.
Some say the President does not want to lay out his plan. He has to lay out his plan. He is the President. We are just legislators. Senator Corker and I have put out our plan. Who pays attention to that? Madam President, $1 trillion in reductions and a $1 trillion increase in the debt ceiling--it is out there. That is not going to work. However, if President Obama, with his skills, calls together Simpson and Bowles or his advisers and says: Here is my plan to save Medicare, here is my plan to save Medicaid, here is my plan to fix the debt, and I want bipartisan support to do that, he will get it. At first, because it is a difficult issue, everybody will say: Oh, no, we can't do it that way. We need to sit down, talk, and come up with a result. I think the Republican leader has shown he is prepared and willing to do that. He has said it and done it on other issues. I don't know what else the rest of us can do to show that.
What I am trying to respectfully say today, as much as anything, to the President of the United States is congratulations on your inauguration. I was there. I was proud to participate in it and have the opportunity to speak for a minute and a half about why we celebrate for the 57th time the inauguration of an American President. We celebrate it because our country is distinguished from most other countries in the world by the peaceful transition or reaffirmation of the largest amount of power in the world. We have our political contests, and then we have the restraint to respect the results.
After winning the election, it is important, first, to get the fiscal house in order. The time to do it is while we have a divided government. The time to do it is while the President is at the peak of his popularity. The time to do it is while the House of Representatives--the Republican House--has created a window of 2 or 3 months to deal with all the fiscal issues. The time to do it is after 2 years of discussion with Republicans and Democrats in a bipartisan way about the need to fix the debt and the importance of it for the country.
My hope is that as the President and his advisers look at the Senate, they see a willingness to solve the problem of fixing the debt in a bipartisan way. I get the feeling they don't believe that about us. I don't know what else we can do to cause them to believe that. There is not the same kind of comfortable, back-and-forth relationship there should be. I have heard some people say: Well, the Johnson-Dirksen days are ancient history. That was a long time ago. However, human nature doesn't change. Human nature doesn't change in 50 years, 100 years, or 500 years.
There is plenty of good will across the aisle and on this side of the aisle, at the beginning of this term, to work with a newly inaugurated President and say: Mr. President, we are ready to fix the debt. Provide us the leadership. No great crisis is ever solved without Presidential leadership in the United States. You are the President; you are the only one who can lay out the plan. We will then consider it, amend it, argue about it, change it, and pass it. After that, we can get onto the President's agenda, about which we will have a difference of opinion, but he will go down in history as the man who was willing to do something hard within his own party, which was to fix the debt and save the programs seniors depend upon to pay their medical bills.
I hope I can say that in the spirit of someone who participated in the inauguration and admires the President's considerable abilities. I hope he and his advisers stop, take a look, and say: Maybe we were wrong. Maybe this is the time to do it. Maybe we are the only ones who can do it, so let's make a proposal and get started.

508,AL.SESSIONS,AL,Sessions,"Madam President, I was pleased to hear a few days ago that Senator Schumer said we would have a budget in the Senate. It has been now, I think, about 1,370 days, give or take, since we have had a budget in the Senate, even though plain statutory law requires the Congress to have a budget. Now Senator Murray has followed up today, I believe, with a quote saying: ``. . . the Senate will once again return to regular order and move a budget resolution through the Budget Committee and to the Senate floor.''
So the Budget Committee has not been meeting. It has not been doing its duty. As the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, I have been aghast at the process and have talked about it for now for over 1,000 days. So this will be a good step.
My colleagues would like to suggest somehow that they decided to do this out of the goodness of their hearts because it is the right thing to do. But I think the American people have had a belly full of this.
The U.S. House of Representatives has repeatedly passed budgets, but the Senate has refused to even bring one up in committee or on the floor for over 2 years now. They have said they are raising the debt limit for about 3 months, but they have declared that the Senate does not get paid until we have a budget. Right now there is no punishment for not passing a budget. I was a Federal prosecutor for over 15 years and know how to read a code. It has no penalty for failing to pass a budget. It says the Senate should bring up a budget. It should complete the budget process in committee by April 1 and then the full Senate should take it up and it should be completed by April 15. The Senate is given priority: 50 hours of debate, virtually unlimited amendments--an opportunity to debate the financial condition of America.
That is why it has not happened. Senator Reid, the Democratic leader for the last several years, has said it would be foolish to have a budget. What he meant was that it would be foolish politically. Because when you bring up a budget, this is a tough thing. The House did that.
Paul Ryan offered a historic budget that would change the debt course of America and put us on a sound path. They had to make some tough choices. So they were, of course, attacked in the election--Oh, these are horrible people; they want to throw old people off the cliff and that kind of thing and it was irresponsible--while during this entire process, the Senate was in direct violation of Federal law that required us to bring up a budget. We did not bring it up because it would be foolish, foolish politically, because we have to take tough votes. We have to stand and be counted. Numbers have to be analyzed: How much are you truly going to raise taxes? Oh, well, is that going to change the debt course?
Is this latest $600 billion tax increase going to change the debt course of America? No; it is not. Our deficit last year was about $1,080 billion. How much would this tax increase, this $600 billion, have changed that? That is $60 billion a year. Instead of $1,080 billion or so in deficit, our deficit would have been $1,020 billion. Is that going to fix our problem? No, it will not.
These are difficult problems. These are very difficult problems, and it is not going to be easy. But it was easy to attack the House while not producing a budget. It is a pretty flabbergasting thing to me. So I am glad we are now going to have this process. It will not be easy for Republicans. It will not be easy for Democrats. But what are we paid to do? What responsibility do we have as the Congress--that has the power of the purse--if not discussing the great issues of our time?
We are on an unsustainable debt path. Last year there was another trillion-dollar deficit, and they are projecting we will have a trillion-dollar deficit this year. That is 5 consecutive years of trillion-dollar deficits. I know President Bush was criticized, and correctly sometimes, for spending too much. The highest deficit he ever had in 8 years was $470 billion. The year before he left it was $160 billion. President Obama has averaged well over $1,000 billion a year in an annual deficit ever since.
This is not sustainable, as every expert has told us time and time again. So I am worried about it. Maybe we can move out of these secret meetings where the Senate just sits around and we wait for the people to appear, write us a bill at midnight on December 31--actually 1 a.m. on January 1--that is supposed to handle it and nobody has even read it.
That is what we have been doing for the last 4 years. It has worked out good politically because it has kept an honest discussion of the dangerous path we are on from being part of the public debate. We have to have it part of the public debate. I am not saying this budget, if it moves through the Senate, is going to solve our problems and that it will be adopted. I am not saying that. But I do believe the American people will understand better the challenges we face and Senators will understand better the challenges we face, how deep they are, how systemic they are.
In 2011, after Republicans won a victory in the midterm elections, there was hope we would have a new budget from the President, that he would reach out to the House that had gotten a Republican majority for a change--they took back the majority, and there were more Republicans in the Senate--and that the President was going to produce a budget that would put us on the right path and maybe a historic path that would help make Social Security and Medicare sustainable, preserve those programs so people can go to bed at night and feel confident these programs not going to go bankrupt and there are not going to be dramatic cuts. We can do that. It would take some belt-tightening, but we could do that. Yet the administration refused: You are just partisan, Sessions.
I am saying, without fear of contradiction by anybody who knows what has happened, that this administration basically has not wanted to talk about those deep spending issues that amount to more than half the money we spend.
That was a challenge. Maybe that logjam has broken and this budget process will give us an opportunity to move forward.
I do not like to be critical of nominees or anyone. I try to be as courteous and respectful as we can to people whom we deal with on a regular basis in the Congress. But I have to share with my colleagues a deep feeling that we have a serious credibility problem with credibility on debt and financing. We have to end that credibility problem. We have to be honest and deal with real numbers.
In January of 2011, Mr. Jack Lew, the then-Director of the Office of Management and Budget, with a substantial staff--one of their primary duties is to produce a budget every year--submitted the President's Budget to Congress. The President always submits a budget--it has been late, but they have always sent them over. The Senate has not moved budgets like it is required to, but every President has always sent over a budget. There was great hope that the budget would be the kind of breakthrough--with a Republican House and a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate--that somehow this would be an opportunity for historic agreement to put America on a sound path and get us off these trillion-dollar deficits, put us on a path to a balanced budget and do the kind of things that are necessary for the welfare of our country.
Mr. Lew produced the budget, and he went on television immediately and talked about it. On Wednesday of that week, he was going to be before the Budget Committee, but this is what he said in his CNN Sunday morning interview about his budget. I would ask you to listen to these words, colleagues and friends, anybody who is watching, and see what they mean to you. He said:
Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the point where we can look the American people in the eye and say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spending money that we have each year--
Money that we have each year--
and then we can work on bringing down our national debt.
That was on CNN.
So he appeared before the Budget Committee and I asked him if that was an accurate statement; did he stand by that. He said: Yes, sir, and he never wavered from that.
I will just say that as part of the budget process we get a stack of documents--this much--from Mr. Lew's office. The Office of Management and Budget submits them--supporting documents--as part of their process. They are easily ascertainable. The numbers are not in dispute.
The lowest single deficit over 10 years that Mr. Lew projected was more than $600 billion. In other words, there was never a balanced budget, never paying down the debt, never a single year we were not borrowing at least $600 billion.
None of what he said is accurate. It is breathtaking. I called it the greatest financial misrepresentation in history. It would have added $13 trillion to the debt of the United States over 10 years, by his own estimate, not stuff I made up. Yet he said we are not going to be adding to the debt anymore.
So I thought, if a businessman reported to potential stock purchasers, our company is on the right track, we are not adding to our debt anymore--we are going to look the American people in the eye and say we're not adding to the debt anymore, we are spending only money we have--you are borrowing--the least amount of money you have borrowed in a single year is $600 billion, larger than President Bush ever had in 8 years as President.
When I asked him about it, he insisted that it was true. So we have got a problem here, and that is why I am not going to support Mr. Lew for the Secretary of the Treasury. I am not going to vote for him. I believe he knew exactly what he was saying. He produced a budget that was panned by virtually every editorial board in America. They hammered it as failing to meet the challenge of our time, and he knew it was that way. He is not a person who doesn't understand these issues. He knew what it was all about. But they decided they would go out and spin it this way. They would say it did what the American people wanted.
I hate to be this harsh, but there is only one conclusion. They decided to produce a budget that did not change the debt course of America and left us on an unsustainable path. Even their own numbers show that, but they would tell the American people this, say it was fixed, and maybe lull them into a false sense of confidence.
Then they attacked Paul Ryan of the Republican House for producing a realistic budget. It wasn't a dramatic budget, it didn't even balance in 10 years, but it changed us and put us on a sound path. They would attack him as not caring about people, and for 2 years that is what has happened.
Once we bring a budget to the floor of this Senate, Republicans and Democrats are going to find out this is a very difficult situation we are in. The challenge is going to be very difficult, and we are going to have a hard time dealing with it.
Mr. Lew didn't just make that comment to CNN, in case you think I am exaggerating here. He also said this in an NPR, National Public Radio, interview on February 15, 2011, the day, I believe, of a Budget Committee hearing:
If we're able to reduce the deficit to the point where we can pay for our spending and invest in the future, that is an enormous accomplishment. This budget has specific proposals that would do that.
He looked the American people in the eye, or, I guess, talked to their ears on NPR, and said his ``budget has specific proposals'' that would put us in a position to pay for our spending and invest in the future and reduce our deficit.
He went on to say on February 15, 2011, at the Budget Committee hearing--and I think this was my question, Was this an accurate statement that you made, Mr. OMB Director?
He said:
It's an accurate statement that our current spending will not be increasing the debt. We've stopped spending money that we don't have.
I mean, I almost can't read those words without the hair standing up on the back of my neck. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget appeared before the U.S. Senate Budget Committee, and he said, ``it's an accurate statement,'' this baloney, ``it's an accurate statement that our current spending will not be increasing the debt . . . We've stopped spending money that we don't have.''
Nothing could be further from the truth--the lowest single deficit was $600 billion.
What about on a different CNN interview on February 14, 2011:
It [the budget] takes real actions now so that between now and 5 years from now we can get our deficit under control so that we can stabilize things so that we're not adding to the debt anymore.
He promised, and looked the American people in the eye and said, in 5 years, we are not going to be adding to the debt anymore. He knew exactly what he was saying. He knew exactly what he wanted the American people to hear. There is no ambiguity about it, and it was utterly false.
February 13, 2011, on ABC, he said:
This budget has a lot of pain, [but] it does the job, it cuts the deficit in half by the end of the President's first term . . . It's going to take us a lot of hard work just to take us to the point where we're not adding to the debt.
There is not one year that they are not adding to the debt.
In the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth years of the budget that Jack Lew presented, when you look at his real numbers, the deficit was going up each year. So it was not a fix to our debt problem.
Then he says this on the White House blog, February 13, 2011:
Like every family, we have to tighten our belts and live within our means while we're investing in the things that we need to have a strong and secure future . . . We know that you have to stabilize where we're going before you can move 
So it is going to stabilize us and move us forward.
Well, as I say, that was not well received. The New York Times wrote this on February 5, 2011. That was his op-ed. I won't go into the editorials, but a whole list of those were critical of Mr. Lew.
I would just say this, we are in a difficult financial position. We need honesty, we need a budget that is truthful, we need the regular order so the Budget Committee does its work, and then it comes to the floor of the U.S. Senate--this will be first time in over a thousand days--it guarantees 50 hours of debate, it can't be filibustered, it can be passed with a simple majority, we will know what is in it, and people can offer amendments. That is what should have been happening for a long time that has not been happening. That is what the law requires, and that should be completed by April 15 of this year.
As we go forward, I am confident that we will be better served by public discussion of our debt, not secret meetings. I have been critical of them. I had hoped that some of them would ripen into some good solutions, but all we have had is temporary ``kick the can down the road'' maneuvers, and nothing substantial has been done to change the debt course of America.
By the way, when Mr. Erskine Bowles, whom President Obama appointed to head his fiscal commission, saw this budget in 2011, he said it goes nowhere near where they will have to go to resolve our fiscal nightmare. Everybody knew this budget wouldn't do the job, and that is why it was never brought through the process, and that is why it wasn't brought to the floor for a full budget analysis in committee and in debate on the floor.
So as we go forward, I will be meeting with our new chairman, Senator Murray. She is a great, tough advocate for her values, but she is a good person to work with. I have told her we will try to work with her, but we are going to talk about the great issues of our time, the difficulties we face, and see if we can't make this system work better and try to put this country on a sound financial footing.
We can do it. We can get this country on a sound path. It is not impossible, but anybody who thinks it will be easy is wrong. This is going to take some hard work. As we do that in a bipartisan, open way in the committee, on the floor of the Senate, the American people will be able to digest the difficulty of some of our challenges, and so will our Members in Congress. In the end, that, I think, leaves us in the best position to reach the kind of agreement, compromise, solution, that can put us on the right path, because everybody is going to have to swallow a little bit.

510,MO.BLUNT,MO,Blunt,"Madam President, first of all, this is the first time I have spoken on the floor when you were in the chair. Welcome to the Senate and welcome to the presiding chair.
I want to talk for a few minutes today about a baseball great, a Missouri great, Stan Musial, who passed away on Saturday at the age of 92. Stan Musial was born in November 1920 in Denora, PA. His title was Stan ``The Man.'' He was the youngest of six children. When he wasn't called Stan ``The Man,'' he was just a guy who worked at a company as a young man, whose dad was a Polish immigrant, whose mother was of Czechoslovakian ancestry, and whose dreams were probably not to become a professional baseball player but who was, indeed, a great athlete from the very start.
In his remarks, when he presented Stan Musial the Medal of Freedom in 2011, President Obama said the following:
Stan matched his hustle with humility. He retired with 17 records--even as he missed a season in his prime to serve his country in the Navy. He was the first player to make--get this-- $100,000. Even more shocking, he asked for a pay cut when he didn't perform up to his own expectations.
I don't think that August Busch gave him the pay cut--again, a quote--but I have read the story where Stan Musial was holding out for a pay package somewhere in the mid-90s and August Busch, Jr., who not long before that had bought the Cardinals, called him into the office and said: I'm never going to pay you 90--whatever thousand dollars he was asking for. He said: I'm going to pay you $100,000, and you are going to be the first baseball player to make $100,000.
Stan Musial played for the Cardinals from 1941 to 1963, the only Major League team he played for. He entered the majors in 1941 as the fifth youngest player. He ended his career in 1963 as the third oldest player. He had a record of 24 times being named to the Major League Baseball All-Star team. He won seven National League batting titles, three National League Most Valuable Player awards, and he led the Cardinals to three World Series championships in the 1940s.
Stan Musial--No. 6--had a batting average of at least .300 in every 1 of his 17 seasons--a .300 hitter for every 1 of his 17 seasons. His lifetime batting average was .331. He batted .330 in the year before he decided to retire. He had 3,630 career hits, hitting 1,815 hits in St. Louis at Sportsman Park and Busch Stadium, and he hit another 1,815 on the road. He played as well at home as he did away from home. He missed the entire 1945 season while he was serving in the Navy.
It was a fan at Ebbet's Field--with the Dodgers playing at Ebbet's Field--who groaned as he came to the plate one time in a game--he was always particularly good against the Dodgers. The fan said: Here comes the man. And from that point on, his nickname was Stan ``The Man.''
I had a chance to sit by Tommy Lasorda at a luncheon a few years ago after I had read a biography of Stan Musial. Tommy was sort of the longtime Dodgers manager who was a player when Stan Musial was playing, and he said he thought Stan Musial was the best ballplayer he ever saw play, and he was death on the Dodgers. The Dodgers fans liked him, but it was a real rivalry.
Stan was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame the first year he was eligible, in 1969, and he would be one of the great ambassadors to baseball for the rest of his life. When he retired in 1963, Commissioner Ford Frick said:
Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight.
Stan Musial became an American icon throughout ballparks and over the radio in the 1940s and 1950s. KMOX, in the 1960s, had a booming signal that went almost all the way to the west coast and covered a lot of the South, and the St. Louis Cardinals were the furthest south of any baseball team and the furthest west of any baseball team. Because of that, Stan Musial played on a club that, in many ways, became America's team at that time.
I can remember growing up in southwest Missouri on a dairy farm, and particularly late at night when we were hauling hay--and I can remember this when I was 10 or 12 years old--and whoever was in the truck must have been almost deaf because the driver would have the radio turned as loud as you could turn the radio up, and the St. Louis Cardinals game would be coming out of both windows as we were out there working in the fields or, if we weren't working in the field, we would be sitting on the porch somewhere listening to the Cardinals play, and there was no greater Cardinal than Stan Musial.
Bob Gibson, another great Cardinal and Stan's teammate and fellow Hall of Famer, said:
Stan Musial is the nicest man I ever met in baseball.
And Bob Gibson went on to say he didn't particularly associate nice with baseball, but he associated nice with Stan Musial.
Bob Costas had this to say about Stan Musial:
Stan Musial didn't hit in 56 straight games. He didn't hit .400 for a season. He didn't get 4,000 hits. He didn't get 500 home runs. He didn't hit a home run in his last at bat, just a single. He didn't marry Marilyn Monroe; he married his high school sweetheart. His excellence was a quiet excellence.
ESPN titled Musial the most underrated athlete ever. Only Hank Aaron--thinking about the things Stan Musial didn't do--had more runs than Stan Musial and extra base hits. Only Tris Speaker and Pete Rose had more hits. And only Babe Ruth and Barry Bonds created more runs. But Stan Musial was at the highest levels in all of those areas.
Writing in the St. Louis Post Dispatch this week, Bernie Miklasz wrote:
Let's celebrate Musial's extraordinary life and be thankful for his enduring presence through the decades. Let's keep it simple in honor of this remarkably uncomplicated man. There has never been a more perfect union, a better relationship between an athlete and a town, than Stan Musial and St. Louis. From the time Stan took his first at-bat as a Cardinal, until his death Saturday at his home in Ladue, he was part of the community's soul for 71 years, 4 months, and 2 days.
Many stories about Stan Musial have been told, but I want to mention three that Bernie mentioned in that same article. He talked about when Musial was first inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame--as I said earlier, as soon as you could possibly be inducted. It was an overcast day in Cooperstown. The crowd was quiet, subdued, and a little bit put off by the day. Moments before Musial's official ceremony, the clouds got out of the way and the sunshine emerged, and Dizzy Dean's widow said: ``Stan brought the sun. He always does.''
In the 1960s, a second story emerged of Musial and other Major League stars visiting U.S. troops in Vietnam, and they went to the military hospitals to console the wounded soldiers. One seriously injured soldier looked up at Musial from his hospital bed and said: ``You're the best.'' And Musial's response was: ``No, you are.''
Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Joe Black, an African American, told a story about being racially taunted by players in the St. Louis dugout during a game. Musial, who was batting at the time, and facing Joe Black, stepped out and angrily kicked the dirt to display his disapproval of his own teammates. He waited after the game to tell Black:
I'm sorry that happened. But don't you worry about it. You're a great pitcher. You will win a lot of games.
Black said Musial's support helped him gain the confidence he needed to become a top pitcher.
The fourth and last story Bernie told was of legendary center fielder Willie Mays, who frequently talked about Musial befriending African-American players, relating that at an All-Star game black players were being ignored by the other players. Mays said:
We were in the back of the clubhouse playing poker and none of the white guys had come back or said, ``Hi'' or ``How's it going?'' or ``How you guys doing?'' or ``Welcome to the All Star Game.'' Nothing. We're playing poker and all of a sudden I look up and here comes Stan towards us. He grabs a chair, sits down and starts playing cards with us. And Stan didn't know how to play poker! But that was his way of welcoming us, of making us feel a part of it. I never forgot that. We never forgot that.
Musial didn't make a lot of fiery speeches. He didn't ``lead'' a movement or try to promote himself as an angelic humanitarian. He just did good things.
There is one last story, a love story, between Stan and his wife Lil. This may be the best Musial statistic of all. They were married for 71 years, 4 months, and 2 days until Lil's death on May 3, with Stan following her in January.
I listened to KMOX from the hay truck I talked about earlier, like lots of other Cardinals and Musial fans, but I remember the first time I saw Stan Musial play at Sportsman Park. I remember the first time, 30 years later, I actually met him, when I was the Secretary of State in Missouri. Getting to meet Stan Musial was about as good as it got even then. I remember hearing him play ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' on his harmonica.
Baseball was lucky to have him, Missouri was lucky to have him, and the Cardinals and St. Louis were lucky to have him, and I am pleased to be here today to say how much we appreciate Stan Musial.

511,MO.MCCASKILL,MO,McCaskill,"Madam President, I want to thank my colleague. He and I disagree on many things, but we agree on many things also, and one of those things usually begins and ends with the State we love, Missouri, and certainly some of our most famous and beloved people who come from Missouri. Obviously, there is no one who deserves more love and respect than Stan Musial.
There are so many memories about Stan Musial that I want to try to encapsulate today, but the interesting thing about the memories I have about Stan Musial is that I don't have these memories because I am a Senator. They do not belong uniquely to me because I am an elected official. I have these memories that I share with hundreds of thousands of people who were lucky enough to encounter Stan Musial during his time on Earth.
You know, when you meet somebody, and you can tell they are kind of looking over you to try to find the person who is more important behind you or maybe they are impatient because they do not think you are a big enough deal to be taking their time? If you look at our sports icons today who travel with posses and have entourages and certain rules about who can come near them and who can't and when, that was not Stan Musial. Not one day of his career or one day after his career did he consider himself untouchable. He saw it as his duty and obligation to be there for all fans. Whether it was somebody who worked at the ballpark sweeping after the game was over or whether it was a very talented ballplayer from another team, everyone was equal in Stan Musial's eyes. What a wonderful American value.
I could stand here today, Madam President, and talk about his amazing record as a baseball player, his unique swing, and the beauty of his accomplishments in America's favorite pastime, but what we need to focus on as we mourn the loss of this living legend is his character because it was his character that brought universal love, respect, and devotion to the man, our man, Stan ``The Man.''
I know Senator Blunt talked about this story, but I want to elaborate a little bit.
It is 1952. Joe Black has just been called up to the majors after spending 1 year in the minors with the Brooklyn organization. He is facing Stan Musial. Now, keep in mind that this is an accomplished baseball player who had won two championships in the Negro Baseball Leagues, and it had only been a few years since Jackie Robinson had, in fact, broken the color barrier for Major League Baseball. He is facing Stan Musial, who already was the most feared hitter in baseball. He is standing there as a Black man on the mound in this baseball game, and out of the Cardinal dugout come jeers and taunts. In fact, one of the things said was, hey, Stan, you are not going to have any trouble hitting that ball against that dark background.
When the game was over, Stan Musial decided not to stay in the Cardinal dugout. Joe Black told the story that as he sat in the dugout, he felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked up, and there was Stan Musial from the opposing dugout saying to Joe Black: You are going to be a great pitcher.
Now, that encapsulates the character of Stan Musial.
Chuck Connors, ``The Rifleman,'' used to tell this story. He was a struggling hitter for the Chicago Cubs.
I may need to explain to you, Madam President, but I certainly don't need to explain to anybody in Cardinal Nation that the Chicago Cubs are an opponent. Now, we don't like the Chicago Cubs in Cardinal Nation.
Chuck Connors asked a teammate what he should do about his swing. He was struggling with being able to hit in the majors, and they all told him the same thing: The only guy who can help you is Stan Musial. So even though he was reluctant to approach a hitter on the opposing team, he went to Musial and asked for help, and, of course, Stan responded as all of us would expect he would; he spent 30 minutes in the cage with an opposing player trying to help him with his swing. Connors recounted that he really wasn't ever that good of a hitter, but he said he never forgot Stan Musial's kindness.
And when he finished watching me cut away at the ball, Stan slapped me on the back and told me to keep swinging.
After the 1946 season, the promoters from the Mexican League decided it was time for them to up the ante on baseball. At the time, Stan Musial was making the enormous sum of $13,500 playing for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Mexican League came to Stan Musial and said: We are going to offer you--a king's ransom at the time--$125,000 for 5 years. That was a lot of money for Stan Musial and his family, but he turned down the Mexican League. When asked about it later, he said:
Back in my day, we didn't think about money as much. We just enjoyed playing the game. We loved baseball. I didn't think about anybody else but the Cardinals.
Harry Caray knew Stan Musial for over 50 years. He would often tell the story of Stan Musial wandering out of the ballpark after a steaming doubleheader--and trust me, we can have steaming doubleheaders in Missouri--looking as if he had been through 15 rounds in a prize fight and every single thing in his body language signifying that he was exhausted and just wanted to go home and lie down. Instead, when he got to his car, he found fans waiting for him. ``Watch this,'' Harry Caray told a friend. And sure enough, Musial's whole body straightened--like Popeye had just eaten a can of spinach--and he started shouting, ``Whaddya Say! Whaddya Say!'' And he signed every single autograph of all the fans surrounding his car. Harry Caray loved telling that story not because it was unusual--that is who Stan Musial was--but for the opposite reason: because it was ordinary. Even in his time, when baseball players weren't paid as much and so were more part of the community, Stan Musial stood apart by standing with the people in the community.
It wasn't just Cardinal Nation that worshipped Stan Musial. His opponents, the opposing teams--can you imagine this happening today? Believe it or not, the New York Mets had a Stan Musial Day at their park. And in Chicago, the home of the Cubs, he once finished first in a favorite player survey, edging out the legendary Ernie Banks, who was also a very nice guy who was beloved by the fans of baseball in the Midwest.
I could go on and on with stories that reflect this man's character. Yes, he has amazing statistics. Yes, him hitting a baseball was a thing of beauty to all baseball fans in America. But, really, what this man was about was that phrase we love to throw around in politics way too often; that is, American values. This was a man who didn't have to talk about his values because he lived them--his love for his family and how close they are.
I am very fortunate to be friends with the Musial family and have visited with them in the days since his death. They received messages from every star in the constellation of American baseball, but one stood out.

513,IA.HARKIN,IA,Harkin,"Madam President, I couldn't help but listen to the words of my friend from Alabama regarding the debt and deficit, and then to be reminded that we did balance the budget not too long ago. In fact, in 1993, we passed a tax bill here in the Senate and in the House--it was signed into law by President Clinton--which set us on a course to reduce the deficit. In fact, by the years 1999 and 2000, we balanced the budget. We had a surplus. Can you imagine that? We had a surplus for 3 years in a row. The Congressional Budget Office and OMB said that if we had continued on that pathway, we would have fully paid off the national debt by 2010.
When I hear my friends on the Republican side talk about reducing the deficit and the debt, we did that. When the Democrats were in charge of the Senate and the House and we had the Presidency, I would also point out that not one Republican on that side of the aisle voted for that bill in 1993. I can remember standing here and debating with my friend from Texas at that time on this bill, and there were all kinds of dire warnings that if this bill passed, we were going to have depressions and recessions; the business community would stop, and it would be the worst thing that ever happened to this country if we passed the Clinton tax proposal. Well, we passed it, but without one Republican vote.
And what happened? We had the largest spurt of economic growth this country had seen almost since the 1950s and 1960s. This was to the point to where, as I said, by the end of the 1990s we had a balanced budget and we had a surplus.
Then President Bush comes into office, and we had surpluses, enough to retire the entire national debt by the year 2010. So what did President Bush say? Well, now we are going to give tax cuts. They pushed through this big tax cut bill for which this Senator did not vote.
That tax cut bill gave a lot away to corporations and to the wealthy of this country, so that they didn't have to pay their fair share. Also, there were two wars we didn't pay for, plus a recession, and now we are in this huge deficit.
We know how to get ourselves out of this fix. We did it in 1993. It was by having the people in this country pay their fair share of taxes, to make sure that corporations, to make sure that those who enjoy the benefits of living in this free and productive society, pay their fair share. This is for all of us to raise the revenues necessary to meet our obligations in education, health, infrastructure building, the security of our Nation, and also to raise enough revenues so we can reduce the deficit.
But it can only be done with fairness and with fair sharing by all, and that is what President Obama has spoken about. He spoke about that in his inaugural address. That is what we have been talking about here for a long time; that is, shared sacrifice on behalf of all, and to make sure that all pay their fair share of taxes in this country so we can once again do what we did in 1993. We can do it again if only my friends on the Republican side will join with us in making sure we raise the necessary revenues to get us out of this hole.

514,VA.WARNER,VA,Warner,"Mr. President, as we get started on this next Congress--and I wish to congratulate the Presiding Officer for joining this Chamber. As someone who has had the opportunity to preside during my first 2 years in the Senate, I commend the Presiding Officer for those actions and look forward to working with you on a variety of projects.
What I want to do today is continue a tradition that I actually inherited from one of our former colleagues, Senator Ted Kaufman of Delaware. Senator Kaufman, who had been a long-time employee of the Senate, came to this floor on a fairly regular basis during his time here to basically celebrate and acknowledge--in most cases--the tireless, unsung work of so many of our Federal employees. As we debate budgets, debt, and deficit, we oftentimes recognize we have to make extraordinary and difficult choices in cuts. In many instances, behind all of those cuts are Federal employees who do remarkable work in keeping us safe, providing services, and helping our country grow.
Ted Kaufman used to come down here on a regular basis and celebrate some of those unsung heroes. I was proud to continue his tradition during the last Congress and look forward to carrying it on through another session.
I start this next Congress actually celebrating two great Federal employees, I might add, who both happen to be Virginians who serve as excellent role models. They represent the thousands of professionals who work quietly every day across our intelligence community to keep our Nation safe.
Very often these professionals work in anonymity and many risk their lives in troubled spots far away from the limelight, and that is how it should be. Recently we have seen certain incidents abroad, and sometimes they pay with the highest sign of sacrifice in terms of their lives.
For their service, their late nights and early mornings away from their families, the risks they take, and the sacrifices they make every day--and because they do not hear this nearly enough--allow me to say thank you to those members of the intelligence community.
Today I wish to briefly tell the remarkable stories of two extraordinary women who built their careers at the Central Intelligence Agency. Jeanne Vertefeuille, who is pictured here, passed away on December 29 at the age of 80 after a brief illness.
In announcing her death to the CIA family, Acting Director Michael Morell appropriately described Ms. Vertefeuille as an icon within the agency. If her story were not true, it would read like a spy novel.
Jeanne joined the CIA when she graduated from college in 1954. It was the year I was born and a year Dick Durbin was also young. This was a time when the American intelligence community could be best described as an old boys' club. She was hired at the CIA as a GS-4 typist. This is a woman coming out of college in 1954 hired as a typist.
Over her career, which stretched over nearly a half century, Jeanne Vertefeuille blazed a trail for women in the national clandestine service. She methodically worked her way up to leadership positions. There were overseas postings in Ethiopia, Finland, and The Hague. She became an expert in Soviet intelligence and spycraft. She retired as a member of the Senior Intelligence Service in 1992.
Even after her retirement, she continued her work for the agency as a contractor, making still more valuable contributions and working without a day's break in service until she became ill last summer. As her obituary reads:
She remained a quiet agency soldier . . . purposefully nondescript and selflessly dedicated. She lived alone and walked to work. But if she was a great figure at the agency, Ms. Vertefeuille was also a tenacious and effective one, and in October of 1986 was asked to lead a task force to investigate the disappearance of Russians whom the CIA had hired to spy against their own country.
Together, with colleagues at the CIA she invested years in the methodical and painstaking hunt for a mole. It was through her efforts, and the good work of many others, that we ultimately unmasked the notorious traitor Aldrich Ames in 1984. Remember, this is a woman who joined the CIA in 1954 as a typist.
Aldrich Ames turned out to be one of the most dangerous traitors in the Nation's history. Thanks in large measure to Ms. Vertefeuille, he was convicted of espionage and is now serving a life term without parole.
Jeanne Vertefeuille's story does not end there. The Washington Post recently described how one of her colleagues, Sandy Grimes--another Virginian who worked with her on the Ames task force--stepped up over the past year to care for Jeanne as she was battling cancer.
Sandy Grimes, a career CIA employee whose parents worked on the Manhattan Project, ultimately served as Jeanne's primary caregiver. She sat with her each day during the final 3 months of her remarkable life. She monitored Jeanne's care and tried to make sure she remained comfortable. She often brought personal messages of support and appreciation from their former colleagues. Ms. Grimes said:
I felt an obligation to be there with her. I can't imagine not doing it. I was the one Jeanne would accept. I owed it to her as a friend.
By all accounts Jeanne Vertefeuille was an intensely private woman, and she doubtless would recoil at the attention she is now receiving. One cannot help but be inspired by this true-life story of service, patriotism, and friendship demonstrated by these two great employees, Sandy Grimes and the late Jeanne Vertefeuille. Their service reflects well on the thousands of other intelligence professionals whose names can never be revealed. Both of them deserve our recognition and thanks.
During the last Congress I joined 14 Senators in a Joint Resolution to mark the U.S. Intelligence Professionals Day. At some point during this Congress, I hope we can gather more supporters so we can have a day designated on a more formalized basis to recognize the enormous contributions made by intelligence professionals. Again, this is an effort to bring respectful attention to these quiet professionals who literally--as a member of the intelligence committee, I can testify to this--keep our Nation safe every day without any thought of recognition.
Again, I look forward to working with my colleagues so we can introduce this resolution in the next Congress.
As I conclude my remarks, I see my friend the distinguished majority whip. We have spent a lot of time over the last 2\1/2\ years grappling with the challenges around the debt and deficit and trying to make some of the very hard choices we are going to need to make as a Nation.
While it appears that we may be avoiding some of the immediate consequences of the so-called debt ceiling debate, which I am glad to see, never should the full faith and credit of the United States be used as a political hostage. Again, I want to compliment my friend the Senator from Illinois who has been as stalwart as anyone in this Chamber at stepping up and who has been willing to speak truth to even those who are the most supportive about some of the challenges and choices we have to make.
We are going to have to proceed at a level of spending that is less than what we have had in the past. As we think about cutting back budgets, I think it is important to remember that behind many of these budgets, there are not just numbers but there are incredible professionals who give their life's service to making this a stronger Nation. So with this tribute to Jeanne and Sandy, I commend these two great Federal employees.
I will be back on a regular basis to celebrate Federal employees throughout this Congress because too often in today's day and life, government service is disparaged. But for Jeanne Vertefeuille and Sandy Grimes we might not have as safe a Nation as we do today.

516,IL.DURBIN,IL,Durbin,"Mr. President, it has been said in St. Louis, MO, baseball is not a sport, it is a religion. If that is true, Stan Musial was a St. Louis civic patron saint.
Stan Musial was an icon in St. Louis. He was the best ballplayer to wear a Cardinal's uniform and one of the best to play the game of baseball.
Stan Musial was my childhood hero when I was a boy and he remains a hero in my life to this day. When a person reaches my age, and maybe my station in life, they are supposed to be beyond the stage of swooning adolescence. But when it comes to Stan Musial, I am a 10-year-old kid all over again in East St. Louis, IL, buying more bubble gum than I can possibly afford in the hope that I would open one of those packages and find, covered in pink powder, a card that had Stan Musial's picture. It was the treasure of my youth, and it still would be today if my mom had not thrown those cards away.
Stan Musial's death has hit the Cardinals Nation like a death in the family. One Cardinal fan spoke for many of us when she said losing Stan Musial ``is like losing a grandparent. It's hard not to tear up.''
I grew up in East St. Louis across the river, and my most prized possession when I was a kid was my very first Stan Musial Rawlings baseball glove. As a kid I rubbed that glove with something called Gloveoleum until I was the only one who could still see Stan Musial's name burned in the leather. One of the highlights in my life came 2 years ago when I got to meet Stan Musial in person for the very first time in my life. It was at the White House, February 11, 2011. Stan Musial was there to receive from President Obama the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He is one of only eight other baseball players in the history of America to receive that prestigious honor. Listen to the company he joined: Joe DiMaggio, Jackie Robinson, Ted Williams, Roberto Clemente, Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, and the famous Buck O'Neill.
At the White House I stood patiently waiting for the moment to ask Stan Musial to sign that old baseball glove, which I still have and have had since I was a kid. He agreed to do so. What a thrill. I was 10 years old all over again.
Outside Busch Stadium in St. Louis is a statue of Stan ``The Man'' in his playing prime. He is coiled up in his batting style. Every coach said don't bat like Stan ``The Man,'' even though he has great numbers. If you do that, you will never hit the ball. We all tried; the coaches were right. Etched in the base of that statue are words that Major League Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick said when Stan retired in 1963: ``Here stands baseball's perfect warrior. Here stands baseball's perfect knight.''
On the field and off Stan Musial was always a gentleman, always a champion. He exemplified the values of sportsmanship, discipline, hard work, grace, consistency, and a love of family. Baseball broadcaster Vince Scully, a Hall of Famer himself, once said: ``How good was Stan Musial? He was good enough to take your breath away.''
Stan Musial played his entire 22-year career for the St. Louis Cardinals. He did take off one season in 1945 to serve our country in the U.S. Navy during World War II. His 3,026 games with the same club are second only to the 3,308 games over 23 years by Carl Yastrzemski.
When Stan Musial retired from baseball after the 1963 season, he held 29 National League records and 17 Major League records. Here are just some of his career numbers: a batting average of .331, an on-base percentage of .417, 3,630 hits, 725 doubles, 177 triples, 475 homers--and the first homer I can ever remember seeing on television was the All-Star game in St. Louis, and darned if Stan Musial didn't get up in the 12th inning, parking a home run into the outfield stands, winning it for the National League. I couldn't have been more thrilled, my first exposure to baseball on television. He had 1,951 RBIs and 1,949 runs. He is the only baseball player to finish his career in the top 25 in all of these categories.
Where did he get that nickname? It was coined not by a Cardinals fan but by a Brooklyn Dodgers fan in May 1946, after Musial's four hits helped lead the Cardinals to a 13-to-4 drubbing of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Every time Stan Musial came to the plate, the fans in Ebbets Field said, ``Here comes the man.'' And the name stuck.
The legendary baseball writer Red Barber once described the 1947 season as ``the year all hell broke loose in baseball.'' It was the year Jackie Robinson integrated Major League Baseball. Jackie Robinson would later recall when asked about his baseball career that it was Stan Musial and Hank Greenberg, two players who went out of their way to be friendly and encouraging in that historic and difficult year.
Maybe Stan Musial's greatest baseball day came on May 2, 1954. It was a double header in St. Louis against the New York Giants. He hit three homers in the first game and two in the second.
In 1957, Stan Musial became the first Major League Baseball player to earn the amazing salary of $100,000 a year. Two years later, when his batting average dipped to .255, it was Musial who went to the Cardinals' owners and asked them to cut his salary back to $80,000. He wasn't playing up to what he thought he had the potential to play up to.
Late in his final season, he stayed up all night waiting for the birth of his first grandchild, and the next day he became the first grandfather to ever homer in the Major Leagues. Umpires--and this says something about what a gentleman he always was--umpires never once ejected Stan Musial from a baseball game in more than 3,000 games.
On January 21, 1969, Stan Musial was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on the first ballot. He was named on 92 percent of the ballots--something on which to reflect after what we just went through a few weeks ago when no one made the cut for the Baseball Hall of Fame. Stan Musial was the first player to receive 300 votes on a Hall of Fame ballot.
When he retired, the St. Louis Cardinals retired his number, No. 6. Cardinals manager Mike Matheny has said that when the entire Cardinals team takes the field this year, they will be wearing a No. 6 patch on their uniforms. But then he said:
It will be a call for us to do our very best to live up to that high standard of excellence.
Then he added:
You don't come across names like warrior, prince and knight by just having Hall of Fame statistics. It comes from making an impact in people's lives. I was in that group. Mr. Musial, I say thank you. He's a perfect example of what it means to wear this jersey.
I want to give credit to my colleague, Senator Claire McCaskill. She worked with me--in fact, she led the way in terms of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, along with Senator Bond, for Stan Musial. And she came up with a great idea. I don't know if it is going to go anywhere, but I am going to try to help her make it a reality. She has suggested we can honor this American hero, this regional hero and the values he stood for by naming the new bridge being built across the Mississippi River at St. Louis in honor of Stan Musial. I grew up on the Illinois side, and we kind of looked over at Missouri a little differently than most, and they looked at us a little differently too. But if there was one thing that ever united us it was baseball loyalty and Stan Musial. It is a perfect name for a bridge that spans between Illinois and Missouri in that region of the country.
I am proud to join Senator Claire McCaskill, and we will be introducing a bill to name the bridge the Stan Musial Memorial Bridge. Other legislation is being considered in the Illinois and Missouri General Assemblies at this time. I wish them the best in honoring this great man. It was my great honor to join him on that historic date when he was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

518,TN.ALEXANDER,TN,Alexander,"Mr. President, Patti Page died on New Year's Day this year. She was 85 years old. The Senate has not been in session for most of the time since then. I wanted to come to the floor to pay a Tennessean's tribute to Patti Page. Patti Page is best known for our State song, the ``Tennessee Waltz.'' A few years ago, in 2007, when I met her for the first time, she told me the story of the ``Tennessee Waltz.'' I knew some of it, but she completed the rest of it.
In 1946, a couple of Tennesseans, Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart, were driving from Memphis to Nashville. That was before the interstate highways. It took a pretty good amount of time to drive that distance. I don't know whether or not they were drinking a beer on the way from Memphis to Nashville but they were relaxed, and one of them said to the other, Why is it Kentucky and Missouri have a waltz and Tennessee doesn't have a waltz? So on the way from Memphis to Nashville they took out a penny matchbox, which is one of these big boxes with wooden matches in it, dumped out the matches on the floorboards of the car, and on the back of the penny matchbox, between Memphis and Nashville, in 1946, Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart wrote the ``Tennessee Waltz.'' They sang it around a few places. Pee Wee King sang it at the Grand Ole Opry. Nobody paid much attention to it. Cowboy Copas sang it. They sang it on Red Foley's show in Missouri. Nothing much happened to the ``Tennessee Waltz'' until 1950, and this is the story Patti Page told me. Mercury Records in New York had a new song they were sure was going to be a big hit. It was called ``Boogie Woogie Santa Claus.'' I don't know whether it was a follow up to ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' but the executives in New York were sure it was going to be a big hit so they wanted the hottest young female singer in America to record ``Boogie Woogie Santa Claus'' so they hired Patti Page. She flew to New York, recorded it for Mercury Records, and then in those days you always had to put a record on the back of the main record. You had to pick a song. It would be the ``B'' side. Just as a throw-away they put on the back of it the song by Pee Wee King and Redd Stewart, the ``Tennessee Waltz.''
We know the rest of the story. The ``Tennessee Waltz'' sold about a million copies. Nobody ever heard of the ``Boogie Woogie Santa Claus'' except those who bought the ``Tennessee Waltz.'' Mike Kerr, who runs Kerr Records in Nashville, told me it was the best selling record ever by a female artist. Patti Page eventually sold 100 million records. She was the top selling female artist in record sales in history.
Growing up I heard her songs, ``Mockingbird Hill,'' ``I Went To Your Wedding,'' ``Old Cape Cod.'' In 1952 she had a song called ``Doggie in the Window.'' It sounds like a silly little song, but it sold a lot of records and a great many Americans remember it. When I was Governor of Tennessee I would travel to Japan, recruiting industry. In the evenings I would go to a restaurant bar with friends, and to my astonishment all of my Japanese friends, many of whom did not know much English, could sing every word of the ``Tennessee Waltz.'' When I inquired about it, it was because it was introduced during the time of the American occupation of Japan in 1950 or so, and according to them, the Asian music doesn't have the same kind of standard that American music has. We get a phrase or a theme in our minds and we never forget it, such as the ``Tennessee Waltz.'' So the ``Tennessee Waltz'' became a song that most Japanese men of that age knew, remembered, and could sing from memory.
I met Patti Page for the first time 6 years ago. It was 2007. She was about 79 or 80 years of age at the time. She told me the story of the recording of the ``Tennessee Waltz'' for Mercury Records. It turned out it was her last recording session. Mike Kerr, the owner of Kerr Records, had invited her to come to Nashville and record an album, ``Best of Patti Page.'' He had invited me to come play the piano while she sang the ``Tennessee Waltz,'' which I did. It was a real thrill and she was very patient to put up with an amateur piano player for her very special song. She told me then it wasn't the first time she had performed with a Tennessee Governor. In 1950 she had performed with Tennessee Governor Gordon Browning at a Memphis theater. This was when she was all the rage, the ``Tennessee Waltz'' was all the rage, and the Governor wanted to sing it with her.
I asked how it went. She said, ``Well, to tell you the truth, the Governor wasn't a very good singer.''
I don't know what she said to others about my piano playing, but I think that was probably about as harsh a verdict as Patti Page ever rendered of any other person.
According to the New York Times obituary, Patti Page once said:
But I don't think I've stepped on anyone along the way. If I have, I didn't mean to.
Well, Patti Page is gone now, but her music is not. Whenever we Tennesseans hear our State song, the ``Tennessee Waltz,'' played, or whenever we sing it, we will remember the voice of Patti Page.

522,KS.MORAN,KS,Moran,"Mr. President, I have only been a Member of the Senate for 2 years, but in that short period of time at least seven other countries have taken actions that we have not taken to better support and attract entrepreneurs to their countries' economies. The map beside me shows those countries: the United Kingdom, Russia, Singapore, Australia, Brazil, Chile, and Canada. Those countries have changed their rules, regulations, passed laws, changed their policies to make their country more friendly to startup businesses and to entrepreneurship.
I wish to focus on and visit with my colleagues about what is happening in one of those countries--our neighbor to the north, Canada--and explain why it is in the interests of our own country to act quickly to retain highly skilled and entrepreneurial immigrants.
In 2002, Canada announced plans to create a new visa to attract foreign entrepreneurs to their country. Canada is developing a plan to admit foreign entrepreneurs who have received capital from venture funds to start businesses in Canada and to admit them to Canada within weeks. A spokesman for the Canadian immigration agency was quoted in September as saying: ``Canada seeks young, ambitious innovative immigrants who will contribute to Canada's job growth and further drive our economy.''
But Canada is not just changing its laws to attract entrepreneurs; it is advertising and trying to lure talent there. The ad we are now showing--this is a full-page ad that appeared in a publication called Fast Company. It is an American magazine dedicated to startups, to technology and innovation. The advertisement for Ontario highlights R&D incentives and innovative and dynamic business environment and the top talent needed to grow new businesses.
We in Congress and in the administration need to take note of this. Other countries, including our friends to the north, are aggressively courting entrepreneurs and talented individuals and they are luring them from here; they are trying to get them from the United States. Canadian Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said: ``We need to proactively target a new type of immigrant entrepreneur who has the potential to build innovative companies that can compete on a global scale and create jobs for Canadians.''
While we work in the United States to continue educating our children with the skills for a 21st century economy and training the next generation of great American entrepreneurs, we also need to be welcoming to those who want to create a business in the United States and employ Americans now. With respect to Canada, America is the country of entrepreneurs, a place where those with good ideas who are willing to work hard can come and make something for themselves.
There is a global battle for entrepreneurial talent and the United States is falling behind. A story I heard while visiting California, the Silicon Valley, last year, illustrates this point pretty well. A large company that just a few years ago was a small startup told me they had plans to hire 68 highly skilled immigrants but could not get a visa for them to work in the United States. Rather than letting this talent go, the company hired them but hired them at their location in Canada. It is certainly troubling that 68 jobs went outside the United States. They were lost in our country because the United States does not have a visa program that works. What troubles me even more is that some of those 68 people hired in Canada will go on to start a business that may result in significant job creation in Canada. Those jobs that could have been in the United States are now in another country and those individuals who may start a company are no longer in the United States but are now in Canada. When we lose entrepreneurs and highly skilled immigrants, we lose the jobs they create.
The good news is there are steps we can take to attract and retain foreign entrepreneurs and highly skilled immigrants. In a bipartisan effort, Senator Warner, Senator Coons, Senator Rubio, and I introduced Startup Act 2.0 last year. Senators Blunt and Scott Brown of Massachusetts joined as cosponsors, and an identical bill was introduced in the House of Representatives with an even number of Republican and Democratic supporters. Again, this year, I am working with those colleagues to reintroduce a bill very similar to that in very short order.
Startup Act 2.0 makes changes to the Federal regulatory process to lessen government burdens on job creators, modifies the Tax Code to encourage investment in new businesses and capital formation, seeks to accelerate the commercialization of university research that can lead to new ventures and, most importantly, provides new opportunities for highly educated and entrepreneurial immigrants to stay in the United States where their talent and new ideas can fuel economic growth and, most importantly, create jobs for Americans.
Startup Act 2.0 creates an entrepreneurial visa for foreign-born entrepreneurs currently in the United States--legally in the United States. Those with good ideas, with capital, and the willingness to hire Americans would be able to stay in the United States and grow their businesses. In many instances, foreign-born entrepreneurs, here legally, have an idea and want to begin a company that will employ Americans but are told their visa does not allow them to remain in the United States.
Take the story of Asaf Darash. Asaf was born in Israel and came to the United States in 2007 after being awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study at the University of California. After completing his doctoral thesis, he founded a software company called Regpack. Asaf raised $1.5 million in financing for the company and hired more than a dozen Americans. His company has the potential to grow quickly and to further create additional jobs. But Asaf, the founder of this dynamic company, is no longer in the United States. My staff contacted him this morning and he said that because of the difficulty in obtaining a visa and the amount of time and effort it was taking, he decided it was easier to move to Israel and take the core of the company, including its jobs, with him. As Regpack grows, new jobs are going to be created in Israel--jobs that could have been in the United States if we had a visa dedicated to foreign entrepreneurs such as Asaf.
Sadly, his story is far from uncommon. Immigrants legally living in the United States who have a good idea and want to start a business have few options available to them. With very few ways to stay, these entrepreneurs, just like Asaf, are forced to move and take their businesses with them and take the jobs they have created and will create to other countries.
I wish to make certain America is the best place for entrepreneurs who want to build America and hire Americans. Passing Startup Act 2.0 will help make this happen.
Entrepreneurial immigrants have long contributed to the strength of our country by starting companies and creating jobs. Of the current Fortune 500 companies, more than 40 percent were founded by first- or second-generation Americans. Today, 1 in every 10 Americans employed at a privately owned U.S. company works at an immigrant-owned firm.
In our mobile world, entrepreneurs have a choice as to where they start a business. For decades, there was no better place than the land of opportunity--the United States of America. But things are changing. Other countries are aggressively seeking the best and brightest, those with entrepreneurial talent, as a way to grow their economy.
I believe most--in fact, I would say at least 80 percent--of my colleagues in Congress agree with the visa provisions in Startup Act 2.0. They understand that retaining highly skilled entrepreneurial immigrants will lead to economic growth and new jobs for Americans. Unfortunately, there is an approach in Congress that has been here for the last several years that says if we can't do everything, we will not do anything. I urge my colleagues let's pass what we can agree on now and keep working to find common ground on issues that still divide us.
Canada and other countries are creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs, for startup companies, but the United States is still the home of the American dream. We need to pass Startup 2.0 so individuals can pursue their ambitions in America.
Millions of our citizens remain out of work. Our economy is barely growing. One would think, common sense would suggest we would work hard together to deal with the issues we have agreement on that would help jump-start the economy.
Let's do that. Let's jump-start the American economy through entrepreneurship and allow those with talents and skills we need to pursue the American dream in the United States of America and thereby strengthen our economy.

524,RI.WHITEHOUSE,RI,Whitehouse,"Mr. President, we all know in the Senate and in the House of Representatives about the low grades Congress receives in public opinion polling. Everybody knows what the public reports: Congress is partisan. Congress is divided. Congress is dysfunctional.
One recent survey that got a lot of media attention reported that Congress is less popular than a root canal. Across the country, people are fed up with Congress. Indeed, Members of Congress are fed up with Congress.
Americans want a Congress that can take on the tough challenges of today. But another recent poll by USA Today and Gallup showed that 77 percent of Americans feel ``the way politics works in Washington these days is causing serious harm to the United States.'' 
Americans think Congress has a problem. Indeed, Americans think Congress is a problem. Well, if we want to fix a problem, we ought to be specific about it. A doctor wouldn't try to fix a patient without a precise understanding of the patient's problem. An engineer wouldn't try to fix a system without a precise understanding of the system's problem. A mechanic wouldn't try to fix your car without a precise understanding of your car's problem. So if we are going to fix what is wrong with Congress, we better have a precise understanding of what Congress' problem is.
Let's start with the Senate. We do have our share of dysfunction in the Senate, I will confess. Undoubtedly, the filibuster is being abused. Certainly, nominees awaiting confirmation are unjustifiably delayed. Indeed, they are held hostage. So everything is not all roses in the Senate.
But we did pass a highway bill, a bipartisan highway bill, that passed the Senate with 74 votes. We did pass a farm bill, a bipartisan farm bill. Although I did not support that particular measure, it was a bipartisan measure that passed the Senate with 64 votes.
We passed the Hurricane Sandy emergency relief bill, also in bipartisan fashion, with 62 votes. We had open debate, we had discussions, we had amendments, and we passed legislation.
Particularly, we passed, by a powerful bipartisan vote of 89 to 8, a bill that avoided tax increases for 99 percent of Americans and extended emergency unemployment benefits for another year and protected us from the fiscal cliff. When it comes to legislating, the Senate actually has a pretty strong bipartisan record.
How did those Senate bills do on the House side? Well, the House couldn't pass its own highway bill. Congress has been doing highway bills since the Eisenhower years. This isn't rocket science. The House couldn't do one. The best the House of Representatives could do was to pass a short-term extension that allowed some of their Members to get to conference on the Senate bill, but they took no bill into conference because they couldn't pass one. Even then, they delayed the conference negotiations, putting thousands of jobs in jeopardy before they finally came around and passed an amended version of the Senate bipartisan highway bill. So their record on the highway bill is nothing to be proud of.
The House also couldn't pass a farm bill. Farm bills are pretty ordinary legislative business too. We do them all the time, but the House has passed no farm bill. We passed a strong bipartisan Senate farm bill. They can't even agree to call up the bipartisan Senate farm bill and pass it. With 80 percent of the agricultural land of the country in drought, there is no farm bill. It is trapped in the sinkhole of the House.
The House almost couldn't pass a disaster bill. If you go back to Hurricane Katrina, when Katrina hit back in 2005, the House of Representatives then had emergency aid on its way to the 850,000 damaged or destroyed homes of the gulf coast in 11 days. In 11 days aid was on its way. This time, with this House of Representatives, the House balked at the bipartisan Senate disaster bill and, finally, it took them 78 days after the landfall of Hurricane Sandy to send help to the half million homes and businesses damaged or destroyed by that storm.
The condemnation of the House of Republicans was bipartisan. The Republican Governor of New Jersey blamed, and I quote, ``the toxic internal politics,'' the toxic internal politics, of the House Republicans for this fiasco. ``This,'' he said, and I will quote again, ``is why the American people hate Congress.''
Is there a problem over in the House? You bet there is, to the point where one departing House Republican Member compared the Speaker of the House to the manager of an asylum and the Speaker's House Republican colleagues to the asylum inmates. That is pretty strong criticism from within the Republican Party.
The reason I give this speech is to try to be precise about what the problem is that has driven Congress's approval into the cellar, and what exactly is that problem? Well, I think the House votes on the so-called fiscal cliff bill and on the emergency Hurricane Sandy aid illustrate what the problem is. Those bills passed the House for one reason and one reason only: The Speaker of the House of Representatives waived what is called the Hastert rule.
What is the Hastert rule? The Hastert rule is probably the most significant contributor to dysfunction in Washington right now. It is not even really a rule, it is a policy, a political policy of Republican Speakers. It began under former Republican Speaker Hastert, hence its common name as the Hastert rule. The rule is that the Speaker will bring no bill to the floor of the House of Representatives without a majority of his own party supporting the bill. It doesn't matter about a majority of Congress; Democratic votes don't count. It is only when the Speaker has a majority of Republican votes supporting it that the Speaker will allow legislation to come to the floor.
It has actually gotten a little bit harder under Speaker Boehner, who has said, I don't feel comfortable scheduling any controversial legislation unless I know we have the votes on our side first, which sounds like he is saying he has to be able to produce a majority of the House out of just the Republican caucus before bringing a bill. But whether it is the original Hastert rule requiring a majority of the majority before they will even bring a bill to the floor or what appears to be the Boehner rule, that they have to have the votes on ``our side first,'' it is a rule of obstruction.
There are somewhere between 50 and 60 Members of the House Republican tea party caucus and a whole bunch more House Republicans who are scared of the tea party and scared of what might happen to them if they get a tea party primary challenger. So getting a majority of his party together for anything reasonable is a challenge for Speaker Boehner.
House Republicans could not get a majority of their conference to support a highway bill. So the Hastert rule kicked in and there was no House highway bill, none--they couldn't do one at all because they couldn't get it through their conference under the Hastert rule. That is why there was no highway bill.
The House Republicans could not get a majority of their conference to support a farm bill, so under the Hastert rule there is no House farm bill. The Speaker won't bring up the stalled bipartisan Senate farm bill, because under the Hastert rule he can't get a majority of his party to support even the bipartisan Senate farm bill.
We were headed for the exact same result on the fiscal cliff--we were headed for the exact same result on the fiscal cliff. Speaker Boehner could not get his party to support protecting America from the fiscal cliff. So, with literally minutes left to spare, and with the House Republican Conference ready, willing, and about to pitch the country off the fiscal cliff, Speaker Boehner did what? He ignored the Hastert rule. He ignored the Hastert rule, and he let the fiscal cliff bill come to the floor of the House without having the votes on ``our side first,'' to use the Speaker's language. Two-thirds of House Republicans actually voted to roll America off the fiscal cliff. Here is the vote count. Republican ``yes'' votes on the fiscal cliff legislation were only 85. Republican ``no'' votes on the fiscal cliff legislation were 151. He wasn't even close to making the Hastert rule.
That fiscal cliff bill passed the House 257 to 167 because the Democrats came out and voted for it, 172 to 16; 172 Democratic ``yes'' votes, 16 Democratic ``no'' votes. Two-thirds of the ``yes'' votes that put the fiscal cliff bill across and saved America from a 100-percent tax increase and protected our economy from the fiscal cliff--two-thirds of those votes came from Democrats. If the Speaker had enforced the Hastert rule, we would be over the fiscal cliff today.
What happened on Sandy? After nearly 3 months of stalling, while my State, while the Presiding Officer's State of New York, while the States of New York and New Jersey, struck by Sandy, were waiting urgently for the relief that we got to the coast within 11 days, they stalled and they stalled because they could not get a majority of the Republican caucus to support Federal relief for our hurricane-ravaged States. Under the Hastert rule, they couldn't get that bill to the floor. So Speaker Boehner once again decided to forgo the Hastert rule. That is how they got the Sandy emergency aid bill passed. Look again at the votes. Republican ``yes'' votes for the disaster bill, 49; Republican ``no'' votes for that bill, 179. That bill was dead on arrival under the Hastert rule. The Republican caucus couldn't support it, wouldn't support it, and we would be without any help now if they had followed the Hastert rule.
On the Democratic side, what was the vote on the Hurricane Sandy bill--192 ``yes'' votes to 1 ``no'' vote. The final count was 241 ayes, 180 nays. The bill passed, but about three-quarters of the support came from Democratic votes.
If the Speaker had imposed the Hastert rule, not only would we be off the fiscal cliff, but we would have failed at providing disaster relief for Hurricane Sandy. The only reason these critical pieces of legislation avoided the fate of the highway bill and of the farm bill is that the Speaker didn't follow the Hastert rule. He couldn't follow the Hastert rule because he wouldn't have been able to pass legislation. If his tea party caucus had forced America off the fiscal cliff, he knew there would have been hell to pay, so he waived the Hastert rule.
Now, of course, House Republicans are all in a fuss about having waived the Hastert rule. One tea party lawmaker admitted that the New Year's Day tax vote left a lot of his fellow Republicans with a very bad taste in their mouth. So it is probably back to Hastert rule business as usual on the House side, with death by tea party to any major bipartisan Senate legislation.
The tea party over on the House side wanted to vote for extreme things, such as voting to repeal or defund ObamaCare over 30 times--over 30 times--or voting to turn Medicare into a voucher program. If it is extreme enough, then they will vote for it. But those are actions which are not supported by the American people, and they can't pass the Senate.
For the regular business of government, for the regular business of passing Senate bipartisan legislation, the tea party-Hastert rule combination is deadly.
So back to where I began. If you are concerned about dysfunction in Congress, if you are wondering why we are less popular than a root canal, if you are wondering why 77 percent of Americans look at Congress and think we are actually doing more harm than good, and if you want an explanation of the dysfunction, take a look at the Hastert rule. If you look at this problem the way a doctor would look at a patient, the way an engineer would look at a system, the way a car mechanic would look at an automobile, and you look for what is broken, be specific; it is the application by the Speaker of the Hastert rule that prevents strong, bipartisan Senate legislation from going forward. When something moves, it is because the Hastert rule has been waived.
So if you want to see what is wrong, that quest takes you straight to the House of Representatives, and there it leads you straight to the House Republican conference, and there it leads you to that toxic combination of the tea party and the Hastert rule.
When you understand the problem, the cure is obvious: The House should ditch the Hastert rule. Call things up for a vote. Let everybody's vote count. Don't refuse to proceed unless only your own party will let you. It is the obvious and only solution. The fiscal cliff bill and the Sandy bill and the votes on those bills prove it.
With those tea party extremists dominating the House Republican conference and ready to pitch the country over the fiscal cliff and leave hurricane victims high and dry, the Speaker had to ditch the Hastert rule. The only way the House can do bipartisan business on major issues is to ditch the Hastert rule.
As we saw, the Senate has its problems, but we are actually doing OK, just as our legislative record shows. Over and over, we pass real, significant, bipartisan legislation after a real process on the floor of argument and amendment. As the House's legislative record shows, the problem is over there. More precisely, the problem is within the House Republican conference. Still more precisely, again, the problem is that toxic combination of the tea party and the Hastert rule.
If we want Congress to function effectively, if we want to succeed at doing the work of the American people, such as the fiscal cliff bill and the hurricane relief bill, and if we don't want to see more important legislation, such as highway bills and farm bills, fail in the House, unable to pass in the House, blocked in the House, the solution for the problem is clear: We have to ditch the Hastert rule and let the House as a body work its will, just as the American people elected it to do.",RI,WHITEHOUSE,-0.527,D,mr presid know senat hous repres low grade congress receiv public opinion

525,NJ.MENENDEZ,NJ,Menendez,"Mr. President, I rise to encourage the Senate to seek quick action on the Sandy relief package that has been long overdue. I know the majority leader is committed to bringing it to the floor as soon as we can get some type of agreement with the other side of the aisle, and I hope that agreement can come quickly because a recovery that is delayed--as this has already been significantly delayed--is a recovery that very likely can fail.
We cannot afford for one of the biggest engines of the national economy, which is the Northeast, to fail in its recovery. This is not only for the sake of the Northeast but for the entire country.
I appreciate the majority leader's steadfast commitment to provide that relief as quickly as possible here in the Senate, but time is a-wasting. It is already Wednesday, and I am concerned we will lose another week before we, in fact, seek passage and then go to the President. From there, it would move on so the resources could begin to flow to communities across the Northeast that have languished since Sandy took its toll.
There is no excuse for delay. We already had the delay in the House. They could have passed the package the Senate passed in a transparent process that had the Appropriations Committee--on both sides--scrubbing the bill. It was brought before the Senate in a fashion in which we like to see the Senate work. I believe there were 25-some-odd amendments that were considered, a full vetting of the legislation, and there was a strong bipartisan vote at the end of that process. It was then sent to the House, and unfortunately it languished and died at the end of the last Congress.
Now the House has acted in a different fashion. So I am happy at this point to accept the House's version--even though I do believe the Senate version is superior in a variety of ways--so it can be sent to the President. Getting relief to the citizens in the Northeast is critically important.
I look at the package the House has, and I say to myself that $50.7 billion in resources, in addition to the flood insurance package that has already passed, will allow our residents and small businesses that have been waiting so long to recover and begin to rebuild. Finally, it will show them that they have a strong partner in the Federal Government and that someone is there for them, as we have been whenever and wherever disaster has struck our fellow Americans throughout this Nation.
Obviously, I would have preferred the Senate bill, which was stronger, but we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We need to get assistance to the victims of Sandy as quickly as possible. This is a vehicle that gets us to that goal.
While the House bill significantly reduces assistance in a couple of areas--including fishery disasters and community development funding, which I think in that respect may stump the recovery of an important industry along our coast and could potentially siphon off billions in CDBG funding that is badly needed right now in New York and New Jersey by amplifying what disasters are eligible for it--I am pleased to say we protected the overall amendment of the CDBG funding from the Senate bill, which is about $16 billion.
While it is not everything we needed since it will now be spread even thinner across even more disasters, we can certainly help as many communities rebuild and recover as we can because time is of the essence. There is a fierce urgency right now. There are many business owners whom I have spoken to who said to me: Senator, I am at a critical juncture. I don't know whether I can reopen. If the government is not going to give me assistance, then I likely won't open because adding more debt, even in terms of a long-term, low-interest loan, is still debt. They say: I took out debt to start this business or: I took out debt to get through the great recession, but I don't really have the option to take out more debt without some direct assistance, such as a grant. A grant would give the help I need to jump-start my business so I can get those individuals I had employed reemployed once again and create an opportunity for our community.
That decision right now for those businesses, which are life-and-death decisions, is pending and hanging by the will of the Senate to act.
I am also pleased that the package the House passed recognizes what I have been saying all along--that funding the Army Corps of Engineers' efforts is critical to rebuilding coastal communities, particularly New Jersey's weakened coastal defenses. We are at the lowest of our immune system as a coastal State, and we already see the biting cold. It is cold throughout the Capitol today, which shows how cold it is outside. Think about those residents who are fellow Americans and don't have a place to call home because they don't have the wherewithal to get their home back in a way in which they can once again be able to live there, raise their families there, and meet their challenges as a family in a warm nurturing environment. That does not exist for many of our fellow Americans because they don't have the wherewithal to decide whether they are going to get the type of assistance to help them rebuild their homes. All of that is pending.
Part of that is the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to reengineer our beaches in a way that ultimately provides not only for the potential of tourism, which is a $37 billion industry in our State, but even more importantly for the protection of lives, property, and protection against repetitive losses. That is what is going to happen when we get this money to the Army Corps of Engineers so they can rebuild our coastal defenses. This package would give Jersey Shore residents and businesses the comfort of knowing they would be better protected in the future than they have been in the past.
It also includes $13 billion in critical funding I sought to help to restore our transportation systems. For example, it would allow New Jersey Transit to repair extensive damage from the storm and allow the agency to build facilities on higher ground to prevent future flood damage, which is a commonsense option. When we think about fiscal responsibility, why would we rebuild only to the very same status that was allowed to be flooded in the first place and caused all of the damage the government would pay for? The passage of this potential package from the House would allow the port authority to finish repairing the PATH station and harden electrical equipment to prevent future damages.
If we could get an agreement, the package that would come to the floor would include necessary policy reforms that I have supported that will streamline recovery efforts and improve FEMA's public assistance programs, which is critical to a successful recovery. These reforms would allow us to rebuild what is in place even stronger and better before there is another storm. Again, this is important in terms of the end results. It is important in terms of the fiscal responsibility to ensure we rebuild in such a way that we don't end up with repetitive damage, which would be more costly to the government.
It would allow a third-party dispute resolution process for major projects. Some of the history we have, particularly with Katrina from Senator Landrieu's experience, is the reality of not having a dispute resolution process, which ultimately forestalled recoveries and critical projects to that State and in those communities. Also, coverage for childcare costs related to disaster recovery through FEMA individual assistance is a critical element.
Without going through all of the provisions of the House bill, let me just say we need to pass this relief package. People are suffering. They are desperately waiting for certainty so they can start rebuilding their lives, their businesses and communities. They are trying to get back on their feet. They need this aid even if it is late and even if it is ultimately longer than other disasters have had to wait. As I pointed out in the past, I think it was 10 days or so when $50 billion flowed to Katrina victims. We are nearly 3 months since the worst disaster on the east coast in terms of a natural disaster that has taken place.
The people of the Northeast, the people of my State of New Jersey and our neighbors in New York desperately need this funding, and it is time to help these fellow Americans. It is time to do it now. It is time to do it this week. It is going to take time for this recovery to take place. The longer we delay, the greater the chance of failure we, in fact, create. I think we want success, not failure. I think we want to understand, as an institution, as I have said many times, that this is the United States of America. That means we respond to the challenges and the disasters that take place in other parts of the country. We do it, hopefully, more expeditiously than this, and at the same time we stand by our fellow Americans so they can reclaim their lives, reclaim their commitments to their communities, reclaim the opportunity to reopen their businesses, to contribute to those communities, to our State, to this Nation, to our society.
So I strongly urge our colleagues who have some reticence to agree to moving forward on a Sandy bill to come to common ground with us, to come to agreement to move this relief package. No American should have to languish months after a disaster to get help. That should not be the standard. The hallmark of our response should be an intelligent but expeditious response to the consequences of a disaster that any American faces. That is our tradition. It is a tradition we should maintain. It is a tradition that, unfortunately, in this particular instance has not been a reality. It is a tradition that I hope we can ultimately embrace once again this week in finally pushing through a Sandy package that can move to the President for signature and bring relief to our communities.

531,MD.CARDIN,MD,Cardin,"Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a proud veteran, a committed Marylander, a great American, and my good friend, Francis Joseph ``Frank'' Chase. Frank passed away on December 11, 2012 in his Columbia, MD home after a brief illness. He leaves behind his beloved family: his wife of 50 years, Carole, a daughter Margaret, and a granddaughter Grace.
Frank loved his country dearly, and he showed it through years of public service, which began in 1955, when he entered the Army for 3 years. Frank then joined the civil service, beginning at the Social Security Administration and later moving to the Health Care Financing Administration, both in Baltimore. When he retired in January 1993, Frank left government service with far more than his Federal pension. For at SSA and HCFA, he had honed expertise that would for many years guide him to continue, as a volunteer, to improve the lives of retirees, persons with disabilities, and others.
A man of boundless energy, Frank was a valued confidant and a member of my health advisory group for the past 20 years. With nearly perfect attendance at meetings and conference calls, he could always be counted on for a warm greeting, sage advice, and wisdom born of compassion and clear-sightedness.
A graduate of Dartmouth College, Frank maintained strong ties with his alma mater, serving terms as president of the Dartmouth Alumni Association and president of the Dartmouth Club of Maryland. He also served his community through volunteer work at Common Cause of Maryland, United Seniors of Maryland, and the National Association of Retired Federal Employees.
Through his involvement in Maryland politics, Frank fought tirelessly for fair election practices, propelled by the belief that, regardless of their views, all Marylanders deserved to have their voices heard. Through my many conversations with him over the years, I discovered a man who loved democracy and justice, and who felt compelled to live his life in service to these causes.
In closing, when I think of Frank, I am reminded of the words of Robert Frost in ``Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening'':
Frank could have led a comfortable, quiet life after retirement, but he chose instead to keep going for many more miles, working for the causes he believed in deeply and the Nation he loved. Like all who were privileged to know him, I will miss my dear friend Frank Chase, and I ask you to join me in celebrating his life.

532,CA.BOXER,CA,Boxer,"Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Catherine O'Neill, the great advocate for refugee women and children who died in Los Angeles last month at age 70. Cathy was my friend and neighbor, and I will miss her.
Catherine was born in 1942 in Queens, NY, the daughter of Irish immigrants Patrick and Bridget Vesey. After graduating from St. Joseph's College in Brooklyn and teaching as a Catholic missionary in Texas, she earned master's degrees in social work from Howard University and in international affairs from Columbia.
Cathy had an extraordinary career as a social worker, writer, editorial director, businesswoman, and director of the UN Information Center in Washington, DC. She was also active in political life, twice running for office in California and serving as finance director for Governor Jerry Brown's 1976 presidential campaign, but she is best known for her groundbreaking and heroic efforts to help refugee women and children.
In 1989, after visiting refugee camps around the world as a board member of the humanitarian International Rescue Committee, Cathy became a founder of the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, now Women's Refugee Commission.
As the Commission's board chair, Cathy traveled the world to listen to refugee women and children and learn about their most pressing needs. She attracted prominent women journalists, academics, and philanthropists to the Commission and became a leading advocate for refugee issues on Capitol Hill, at the UN, and in the media. Under her leadership, the Women's Refugee Commission has shaped policies and practices in the U.S. and around the world to address the needs of women and children displaced by war, persecution, and natural disasters.

534,DE.COONS,DE,Coons,"Mr. President, we are no longer in an election year, which makes this the perfect time for this Congress to take action on real and meaningful election reform. Regardless of which candidates we voted for last November, we can all agree that in the world's greatest democracy, in the year 2013 we should put in place systems which ensure every voter will be able to cast their ballot without unnecessary delays, redtape, or restriction in our next elections. That is why I am looking forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate, with leaders in State and local governments across the country, and with folks in the U.S. Department of Justice to discuss ways we can reform our election process to make voting more accessible for more Americans.
In his second inaugural address delivered just this Monday, President Obama made a point to tie voting rights to civil rights. President Obama spoke of the long American march toward justice. He said:
And the first steps of that march--of the journey toward a better, fairer, more equal society, one where every American, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation or economic status, has the same shot at success--has always started at the ballot box.
President Obama mentioned Seneca Falls, a central moment in the movement for women's suffrage, and Selma, the emotional heart of the fight for equal access to voting rights for African Americans. He said:
Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.
He is right.
The 2012 elections were a wake-up call to those of us who treasure the right to vote. All over our country--in blue States and red States--Americans saw their fundamental right to vote eroded by exceptionally long lines, confusing rules, and widespread voting machine malfunctions. There were problems in more than a dozen States documented in the media.
There were voting machine irregularities in Pennsylvania and Colorado; error-ridden voter rolls in Ohio; delays counting ballots in Arizona; voters waiting in lines 5 hours long in Virginia and 8 hours long in Florida. We have to do better than this.
As Americans, the right to vote is in our DNA. So just days after these 2012 elections, which had such widespread problems, I introduced the FAST Voting Act, the Fair, Accurate, Secure, and Timely Voting Act, along with Senator Warner and colleagues in the House, Congressman Connolly and Congressman Langevin.
Our bill challenges States to implement commonsense changes well before the next election. It would provide incentives and competitive grants to those States that can turn around their poorest performing polling places, improve the administration of their elections, and make voting faster and more accessible to all voters.
As a former county executive myself, I know States and local governments are laboratories of democracy. When it comes to administering elections, many States and counties are getting it right. We can learn from them and replicate their successes elsewhere in the country to ensure these same problems do not plague the next national elections.
For example, Florida was one of many States with rampant election problems in 2012. There were long lines, limited early voting, and other issues that may have disenfranchised as many as 49,000 Floridians, according to a study by Professor Theodore Allen of Ohio State University.
Floridians such as Richard Jordan waited more than 3 hours in a line that just was not moving to try and cast his ballot on election day 2012. He had already worked a 10-hour shift that day. He was exhausted, his back hurt, he was hungry, and ultimately in anger decided he could not wait anymore. He simply gave up and walked away. He was denied the opportunity to cast his ballot by an unprepared, underresourced, or just incompetent election system.
On behalf of voters across the State such as Richard, earlier this month Florida's elections administrators presented Florida's Governor Rick Scott with a list of reforms they would like to see implemented to prevent these problems from happening again. Governor Scott admitted that his own State's election process was clearly in need of improvement. He said he agreed with some of the election supervisors' proposals. In my view, this is a very positive step forward, and one which should be undertaken in every State where there is documented need for stronger, fairer, faster, and freer elections. 
In my view, the government can and should play a role in incentivizing that process to ensure that election improvements are made to last. It can help States move forward in using available technology, and it can ensure States do a better job of enforcing laws that are already on the books.
For example, the National Voter Registration Act, commonly known as the motor voter law, requires States to allow voters to register when they renew their driver's license at the DMV or at other governmental agencies. Yet there are substantial and credible allegations that some States all across this country--whether blue, red, or purple--are not fulfilling their obligations under this act.
In talking with elections administrators from around the country, it is clear to me that compliance with existing law is not complete. We have to do more to ensure voters are afforded the rights given to them under current law and that State agencies are doing what is required to simplify the registration process to maintain uniform and nondiscriminatory voter rolls and provide widespread registration opportunities. Enforcing existing law is just part of the solution to the voting problems we saw across our country in 2012.
We also have to look forward at ways to deliver the best and most efficient voting process to all Americans. There is still much more we can do to meet that goal, and I think part of the solution is the mechanism of the FAST Voting Act.
Our legislation focuses on cost-effective reforms, such as making it easier to register online and ensuring citizens who move to a new jurisdiction can easily transfer their voter registration. If we use modern technology that we already have at our disposal, we can make it easier for all eligible American citizens to cast their ballot and ensure every vote is counted.
President Obama was right to mention election reform alongside the most essential civil rights struggles in our country's history in his inaugural address on Monday. Making it harder for citizens to vote is a violation of their civil rights. Long lines are just another form of voter disenfranchisement. Running out of ballots can be just another form of voter suppression. The fact is access to vote is denied when registration is cumbersome or inaccessible and when early voter vote-by-mail options are just not available.
Let's do something now when we are no longer hamstrung by election year politics in the Senate so that changes that last and make a difference can be implemented well before the next election.
As someone who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and who often speaks with foreign heads of State, civil society leaders, and voting advocates from around the world, it is an embarrassment that in 2012 our Nation could not overcome the simple challenges to ensuring fair and accurate elections all across our country.
If we ignore these assaults on America's civil rights that we saw last November, we are certain to have to endure them the next time around. We cannot stand by and allow that to happen. Our democracy needs to be a model to the rest of the world for how to ensure that every citizen gets to exercise the right to vote.
Let's find a way to come together to put meaningful election reforms in place now before we deny one more American their fundamental right to vote for the candidate of their choice.

535,MD.CARDIN,MD,Cardin,"Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Justice Thurgood Marshall's Elementary School Study Act. The elementary school that Justice Marshall attended, known as PS 103, located in my hometown of Baltimore, is a place of national significance because it marks the site where one of our Nation's greatest legal minds began his education.
Thurgood Marshall is well known as one of the most significant historical figures of the American civil rights movement. By the time he was 32, he was appointed the chief legal counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP. He served at the NAACP a total of 25 years and was a key strategist to end racial segregation throughout the United States.
Perhaps the greatest illustration of this effort was his victory before the Supreme Court overturning the Plessy doctrine effectively ending school segregation with the landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, KS, in 1954. Not only did this case open up educational opportunity and sparked the civil rights movement in this Nation, it also marked the beginning of Thurgood Marshall's career, still a young attorney from Baltimore, as one of the greatest legal minds in all the land. This case was just one of the 29 cases he won before the U.S. Supreme Court.
Fittingly, Marshall was the first African American confirmed to the Supreme Court. He was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1967 and served 24 years, until 1991. On the high court, Marshall continued his fight for the Constitutional protection of individual human rights.
But Thurgood Marshall was not always a legal giant. He was once a young boy growing up in West Baltimore. He received the first 6 years of his public education at PS 103. An apocryphal story goes that a young Thurgood Marshall studied the U.S. Constitution in the basement of the building while serving detention. Regardless of whether or not this is true, the building powerfully tells the story of racial segregation in America, PS 103 was a ``blacks only'' school when Justice Marshall was a student, and marks the academic beginning of one of the country's most brilliant legal thinkers and a pioneer of the civil rights movement.
The building is located at 1315 Division Street in the Upton Neighborhood of Old West Baltimore. The building is part of the Old West Baltimore National Register Historic District, and is listed as a contributing historic resource for the neighborhood. The Old West Baltimore historic district is one of the largest predominately African American historic districts in the country, and its significance is centered on the African American experience in the area.
In Baltimore, we are fortunate to have the National Park Service operate two historical sites, Fort McHenry and the Hampton Mansion. Adding PS 103 is a unique opportunity for the National Park Service to work in Baltimore's inner-city and to reach out and engage people about African American history.
Needless to say, Thurgood Marshall's legacy is one that should be preserved. He was one of our country's greatest legal minds and a prominent historical figure of one chapter of our country's great history--the civil rights movement. This bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of PS 103 to evaluate the suitability and feasibility of establishing the building as a unit of the National Park Service. Preserving the building that was Justice Marshall's elementary school will give Americans insight into Justice Marshall's childhood.

536,IL.DURBIN,IL,Durbin,"Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce two pieces of legislation: the Know Before You Owe Act and the Fairness for Struggling Students Act. These bills will take critical steps toward addressing the student debt crisis facing America.
Every week my office is contacted by young people and their families who share with me their horror stories about student debt. Many of them are college students or graduates who are getting crushed by student loans the size of mortgages. All too often, these young people were lured into attending worthless, for-profit colleges that left them with worthless diplomas and mountains of debt. It is disgraceful. But it is not only young people facing this debt crisis, it is their parents, their siblings, even their grandparents who did them a favor by cosigning on these loans. They, too, are being held responsible when the loans go into default.
Many of these people contact my office because they don't know where to turn. Their debt loan leaves them feeling helpless. They are putting off major life decisions such as buying a home or even starting a family because of crushing student debt. We can't stand idly by any longer and ignore this reality. We have to step up and recognize that this student debt bomb is ticking away.
Student loan debt among college students surpassed $1 trillion last year. The New York Fed reports that balances of student loans have now exceeded the balances on automobile loans and credit card debt in America--student loans. That makes student loans the largest form of consumer debt outside of home mortgages.
Last year, 37 million borrowers held student loan debt. That is more than 10 percent of the population of this country. The average balance is $24,300. But, remember, that is an average. This is a massive amount of debt, and it is having a profound impact on the lives of students and their families across America.
The overall growth in student debt is troubling. The most pressing concern is what is known as private student loans. If a student goes to college, they could qualify for a government-guaranteed loan with dramatically lower interest rates with accommodations based on their employment and even some loan forgiveness. Not so when it comes to private student loans in most cases. Students who take out Federal loans receive affordable interest rates, a lot of protections and repayment options. Private student loans are totally different. Private student loans often have high variable interest rates, hefty origination fees, lack of repayment options, and, unfortunately, crushing penalties.
In 2012 the amount of outstanding private student loans exceeded $150 billion. Students are being steered into these private loans while they are still eligible for the better government loans. Why? Because somebody is making more money when they sign up for private student loans. As a result, many students are being saddled with debt they don't have to be saddled with and sometimes debt they can never repay.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year reported that at least 850,000 individual private student loans were in default amounting to more than $8 billion.
Let me tell my colleagues about one of those students. I have opened on my official Web site a place where those who have student loans and want to share their stories can come. Anna Wilcox, who is 31 years old, did. She attended the Brooks Institute of Photography, a for-profit college owned by the Career Education Corporation.
Anna Wilcox saw a TV ad one day about this so-called Brooks Institute of Photography and decided she would call and inquire. The school called her twice a day until she finally enrolled. The recruiter at the school--this Career Education Corporation School--told her that a Brooks degree would help her make $85,000 a year as a photographer. So Anna enrolled, and when she graduated in 2006, she had a debt of about $170,000, almost all of it in private student loans.
Anna was 24 years old with $170,000 in student debt from this for-profit school. With a variable interest rate that went as high as 18 percent, her balance just kept growing. Her monthly payments on her private student loan now exceed $1,000 a month. Her Federal loans she took out as well had low interest rates. She said those payments are reasonable, and she can handle them. Her parents decided to help her out and cosigned on the loans. Now her parents, in their sixties, are on the hook as well. They have to change their life plans because they wanted to help their daughter, and now they are stuck with a debt of $170,000 for a worthless diploma from a for-profit school.
Well, Anna did find a job, but the job doesn't pay anywhere near $85,000 a year. She just can't keep up with these staggering monthly loan payments. She said she would like to file for bankruptcy, clean the slate, and start over. She can't borrow money to go to a real school. She has wasted her borrowing power on these for-profit schools.
It doesn't do her any good to want to file for bankruptcy. Private student loans are not dischargeable for bankruptcy. If a person signs up as a college student for one of these student loans, it is debt that will follow that person for a lifetime. There is no way to escape it. It is something to think about long and hard when students make that decision.
Anna is very blunt and despondent. She said she made a big mistake going to the school. It was a waste. She thought she would get a better life by going to college. She didn't realize these for-profit schools by and large are a waste of money and cause debt that most students can never pay back. She has bad credit now and a mountain of debt to show for it.
So what are we going to do about it? Are we going to say: Well, Anna, you should have been a little bit smarter when you were 19 years old and sat across the desk from somebody who said: We want you as a college student. You made your mistake, girl. That is the way it works in America, and now you have to pay the price. Is that the answer? Is that the answer when these for-profit schools depend on the Federal Government and taxpayers for 85 to 95 percent of all of the revenue they take in?
These for-profit schools, if we took the Federal money we send their way--if these for-profit schools were a Federal agency, it would be the ninth largest Federal agency in America. That is how much money we are pouring into these for-profit schools.
Let me just put three numbers out for people to reflect on: 12 percent of the students out of high school go to for-profit schools. We know their names. They are students who gather in Washington and come to the galleries. They know what I am talking about. Go on the Internet and try to escape an ad for a for-profit school: University of Phoenix, DeVry, Kaplan. Ring a bell? Well, I can tell my colleagues these are the biggies, but there are hundreds of them. Twelve percent of the students after high school go to for-profit schools.
For-profit schools, though, account for 25 percent of all of the Federal aid to education. They just soak it up. Students borrow and turn it over to the for-profit schools. The student is stuck with the debt. The for-profit school may never graduate you, but they have their money.
There is a third number to remember. The first is 12, the second is 25. The third number is 47. Forty-seven percent of the student loan defaults in America are students from for-profit schools, students being dragged into these schools that charge way too much for tuition and then the student either can't finish the school or gets out of school and can't find a job and they are stuck.
I tell my students back home, if you are not sure, start at a community college. It is affordable. It has a wide array of courses to be offered to you. You will learn a lot about yourself, you will learn a lot about what you want to do in school, and you will not end up sunk in debt like these for-profit schools want to do to you.
We have to do something about Anna Wilcox's plight and many others just like her.
I wish to commend especially one community college in my State, the Elgin Community College. I have been visiting that school regularly and always come home thinking: This college gets it. They have implemented a financial counseling program that goes above and beyond anything I would put into law. All of the students at Elgin Community College in Elgin, IL, must submit a monthly budget detailing all their costs when they are seeking financial aid. The student then has a mandatory, one-on-one meeting with a counselor to review the loan balance, the repayment options, and what happens if they default. This community college has implemented a workshop for students who will be graduating during the upcoming semester to discuss repayment options and give them a complete summary of every loan they have taken out.
These students are facing debt the likes of which they have never seen in their lives. They are motivated by all of the preaching they have heard from their parents, like me, saying: Go to school. Get a degree. They are ready to sign up because they want to do what they think is the right thing. They do not know that the for-profit school is worthless, they do not know that the thousands and thousands of dollars of debt will never be able to be repaid, and they do not know that debt will be with them for a lifetime. So here are some bills I am introducing to address it.
I believe students will benefit more if they have the kind of loan counseling we see at the Elgin Community College. I am joining Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, chairman of the HELP Committee, in reintroducing the Know Before You Owe Private Student Loan Act of 2013.
The legislation requires colleges to confirm a student's enrollment status, cost of attendance, and estimated Federal financial aid assistance before any private student loan can be approved for that student. In other words, if you are eligible for the government loan, for goodness' sakes, take that first. The private student loan is much more expensive, and it is tougher to pay it back. So we want to make sure students who are eligible for government loans know that before they sign up for the private student loans. Often, students have not even applied for Federal aid before they are encouraged by some of these schools to apply for private student loans, or students have not exhausted their eligibility for Federal aid. Requiring school certification would give the school the opportunity to make students aware of Federal student aid options and the most affordable options.
The bill would also require schools to counsel the students about their loan options. Schools would be required to inform students about the differences between Federal student loans and private student loans, and they are stark and dramatic. For students who decide to take out private student loans, the bill would require lenders to provide them with quarterly up-to-date information about their balance and interest accrued. It is not one of these deals where you just keep borrowing and borrowing and borrowing, and finally when you are about to finish school--or years later--they give you the total, and you look at it and say: My goodness, I did not realize I had signed up for all of that debt.
This legislation is supported by a large coalition of educational, student, and consumer organizations and has been recommended by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
The other bill I am reintroducing today is the Fairness for Struggling Students Act. This bill, cosponsored by Senators Whitehouse, Franken, Harkin, and Jack Reed, would restore the Bankruptcy Code's pre-2005 treatment of private student loans.
As I said earlier, since 2005 private student loans have enjoyed a privileged status under the Bankruptcy Code. They cannot be discharged in bankruptcy except under the most extreme circumstances. Only a few other types of debt cannot be discharged in bankruptcy--criminal fines, child support, taxes, and alimony. In contrast, nearly all types of private, unsecured debt--credit card debt, doctor bills--are dischargeable in bankruptcy, but not student loans.
There was no good reason for Congress to give such preferred treatment to these financial institutions that are peddling these private student loans. It was a provision--a sweetheart provision--tucked into a massive bankruptcy reform bill with very little debate and even less justification. There is no evidence that private student loan borrowers were abusing the bankruptcy system before this law was changed. In fact, the private student loan market has been growing--even before this measure was enacted into law. But the private student loan industry got a sweetheart deal out of Congress, and now we are in a situation where many students have overwhelming private student loan debt, and they cannot repay, and they cannot escape. This is devastating for those students and a drag on our overall economy.
There was an article a few months ago in the New York Times, and it talked about a grandmother who was having her Social Security check garnished because she had signed on as a cosigner of her granddaughter's student loan. Her granddaughter dropped out of college and could not pay back the loan, and now we are going after grandma's Social Security check. That is how serious this can be.
A large coalition of student, educational, civil rights, and consumer organizations support this bill. I hope we can move forward with legislation this year. It is time to restore fairness to our Bankruptcy Code when it comes to student debt.
Let me be clear: When used appropriately, student loans are valuable and important. I would not be standing here today if I had not borrowed money from the Federal Government to go to college and law school. I never could have afforded it otherwise. It was called the National Defense Education Act. If I told you the numbers that I borrowed, you would realize how old I am. But at the time, it was scary to have that much debt coming fresh out of law school. I paid it back just like I was supposed to so the next generation could take over. But what I faced, the debt I incurred to go to school and law school, does not even come close to matching what many students have to borrow in the first semester, and that, unfortunately, leads to a debt that some will be crushed with for a lifetime. In many instances, student loans help Americans get a quality higher education and the job skills they need to repay their loans and have a rewarding life and career. But, unfortunately, there are far too many Americans who have been steered into high-cost private loans that will burden them for life and prevent them from fully contributing to our economy.
It is about time we woke up to the reality of what students--millions of students--across America are facing, and their families. We have a responsibility to them over and above the profits that are being earned by for-profit schools and the financial institutions peddling these private student loans with these outrageous interest rates and terms. It is time for this Congress to listen to working families and their kids all across America to restore transparency, fairness, and common sense to private student loans. I urge my colleagues to support these bills.

537,RI.REED,RI,Reed,"Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Murkowski, Durbin, Collins, Tom Udall, Murray, Lautenberg, Blumenthal, Coons, Klobuchar, and Stabenow in the introduction of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act Reauthorization.
This legislation is named for the son of Senator Gordon Smith, our former colleague, who took his own life at the young age of 22. After this tragedy, Senator Smith rallied support from members across the aisle and in both chambers to prevent other children from doing the same with passage of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act in 2004. Since then, it has retained its bipartisan support among Members of Congress and over 40 member organizations of the Mental Health Liaison Group. 
However, the recent horrific mass shooting in Newtown, CT shows that more work must be done to address the mental and behavioral health of children and young adults before they hurt themselves and others. Indeed, what is so clear now from this terrible tragedy is that we have young people who desperately need help. Parents also need help in identifying early warning signs of mental illness and accessing the appropriate treatment before it is too late.
The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act authorizes critical resources for schools, elementary schools through college where children and young adults spend most of their time, to be able to reach at risk youth. Currently, this law supports 40 States, 38 tribes and tribal organizations, and 85 colleges and universities in their efforts to address mental health and prevent suicides among their youth.
The bill my colleagues and I are introducing today would increase the authorized grant level to States, tribes, and college campuses for the implementation of proven programs and initiatives designed to address mental illness and reduce youth suicide. It will enable more schools to offer critical services to students and provide greater flexibility in the use of funds, particularly on college campuses.
Suicide is now the second leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults age 10 to 24, up from the third leading cause of death in this population just a few years ago, and results in 4,800 lives lost each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, the CDC reports that 157,000 young adults in this age group are treated for self-inflicted injuries annually, often as the result of a failed suicide attempt.
We can play a role in helping these children and their families. I am pleased that President Obama and Vice President Biden recognized this and included in their Plan to Protect Our Children and Our Communities by Reducing Gun Violence a recommendation to increase support for young adults ages 16 to 25, a population with high rates of mental illness, substance abuse, and suicide that is unlikely to seek help. Indeed, passing the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act Reauthorization is one way we can better address the mental health needs of this population.
My colleague, Chairman Harkin, will be holding a hearing on the status of the mental health system in our country tomorrow. I look forward to continuing to work with him and others to act on the President's recommendations to improve mental and behavioral health care services, particularly for children and young people. This should be something that we do automatically when it comes to the welfare of our children but is even more urgently required in the wake of the terrible recent tragedies in Connecticut and elsewhere.

538,GA.CHAMBLISS,GA,Chambliss,"Mr. President, I rise to speak today about our Tax Code as well as our economic future. There is a problem with our Tax Code, one that hits home with nearly all Americans; that is, its complexity. In the past few years I have met with hundreds of constituents who are worried about this issue. Individuals, small businesses, farms, and large corporations alike struggle with meeting their obligations to the IRS because of the complexity of our current Tax Code.
Earlier this month the IRS Taxpayer Advocate revealed some startling figures in the Agency's annual report to Congress. It estimates that individuals and businesses spend 6.1 billion hours each year complying with the IRS tax filing requirements. The complexity of the Tax Code is so burdensome that 9 out of 10 taxpayers now pay a professional preparer or use often costly commercial software to assist in tax preparation.
Then there is the problem with our corporate taxes. The United States has the highest marginal effective tax rate among the largest developed nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. According to recent studies by the Cato Institute, that rate for U.S. corporations is almost 36 percent. In fact, only Argentina, Chad, and Uzbekistan have higher tax rates than does the United States. While the U.S. corporate rates have remained high, other countries are lowering their rates. Sweden, for example, has become the latest country to announce that it will lower corporate tax rates, in part to help attract more foreign investment. Our corporate tax rates continue to be higher than they should, and we lose our competitive advantage to other nations in part because of that high tax rate.
I want to talk about a way to fix both these problems. Since joining the Senate, I have introduced in each new Congress the Fair Tax Act. Today I am reintroducing this legislation because of my belief that the Fair Tax Act can fix the problems built into our current Tax Code. The fair tax will promote freedom and economic opportunity by eliminating our current archaic and inefficient Tax Code and replacing it with a simpler, fairer means of collecting tax revenue. It will repeal the individual income tax, the corporate income tax, capital gains taxes, all payroll taxes, self-employment taxes, and the estate and gift tax in lieu of a 23-percent tax on the final sale of goods and services. Elimination of these inefficient taxing mechanisms will not only bring about equality within our tax system, it will also bring about simplicity. It will provide tax relief for business-to-business transactions. These transactions, including those for used goods that have already been taxed, are not subject to the sales tax, so there would be no double taxation.
Some of my colleagues have asked how the fair tax would affect our revenue on our entitlement programs. Social Security and Medicare benefits would remain untouched under the Fair Tax Act. There would be no financial reductions to either of these vital programs. Instead, the source of the trust fund revenue for these two programs would be replaced simply by the sales tax revenue instead of by payroll tax revenue.
Another question I get is how the fair tax would affect impoverished Americans. Under the Fair Tax Act, every American would receive a monthly rebate check equal to the spending up to the Federal poverty level, according to Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. This rebate would ensure that no American pays taxes on the purchase of necessities.
We have made nearly 5,000 changes to the Tax Code since 2001--I have supported some of them, and I have not supported others--all in the name of improvement and economic benefit. I believe we can do better than simply lowering our taxes. I know we can make a bigger impact on our economic future by ridding ourselves of a tax structure that is holding us back.
Ronald Reagan once said:
I believe we really can, however, say that God did give mankind virtually unlimited gifts to invent, produce and create. And for that reason alone, it would be wrong for governments to devise a tax structure or economic system that suppresses and denies those gifts.

539,KS.ROBERTS,KS,Roberts,"Mr. President, I am rising to submit a resolution making it absolutely clear that Congress, and only Congress, has the authority and responsibility to set the Federal debt limit. I should not even have to submit a resolution such as this, but I feel it is absolutely necessary.
Raising the Federal debt limit--the limit we place on government borrowing--as everybody knows, has been a hot topic around Washington. It is a key issue for the start of the 113th Congress. It is another case where if we could just maintain regular order, regular authority to address our problems, that is the best way for us to approach the task of getting our fiscal house in order.
I know there is a lot of dispute over what breaching the limit means. There is a lot of talk about that. It is clear a great deal of the public and our financial markets are extremely concerned about the Federal Government's ability to meet its financial obligations once we do hit the limit.
The President has asked for a very large increase in the debt ceiling, and some in the administration have called for no limit at all. Others of the administration and in the House are calling for Congress to give up its authority to set the debt limit--rather amazing--thus giving the executive branch unilateral authority to borrow. This is not a good idea.
If the Federal Government does not collect enough revenue to pay for all its spending obligations, it must borrow to make up the shortfall. Everybody knows that. We are borrowing now about 42 cents of every $1 we are obligated to spend.
This is clearly--I think everybody would agree on either side of the aisle and the public--an unsustainable situation which will only get worse if we do not begin meaningful discussions over our spending priorities, including--including--entitlement spending to strengthen and preserve those programs for future generations.
The national debt is growing. Everybody has seen that chart. It is about $16.4 trillion. The total public debt outstanding at the end of the third quarter just passed was $16.07 trillion. That is up from $15.86 trillion reported in June 2012. We are on the wrong path.
The Federal debt is now equivalent to at least 73 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product--nearly double the level as a percentage of GDP that we had back in 1990. That is not too long ago.
According to some measures, there has been a 60-percent increase in the debt limit since 2009. At the rate we are going, in a few short years we will be spending more to pay interest on the debt than we will on all discretionary programs outside of defense. Even defense now is going through a very difficult time with the sequester and has already been cut about one-half trillion dollars.
Let me just say that means no money for education. That means no money for agriculture. That means no money for the environment. That means no money for health care. It all goes to pay off interest on the debt.
The Federal debt is the accumulation of this borrowing, including all bills, notes, and bonds issued by the Department of the Treasury.
The current statutory debt limit is $16.394 trillion, which was established on January 28 of last year, 2012--about 1 year ago--under the procedures of the Budget Control Act of 2011.
According to the Department of the Treasury, as of December 31--just last month--total debt outstanding subject to the limit was only $25 million--million; it used to be a lot of money--below the current limit.
Once the amount of outstanding debt reaches the debt limit, the government can no longer issue additional debt to cover the cash shortfalls needed to fund government operations and meet legal obligations.
Similar to the power of the purse, Congress's powers over borrowing are firmly rooted in our constitutional traditions. The Founders understood the potential danger of permitting the executive branch to unilaterally incur new public debt. Article I of the Constitution empowers only--only--Congress ``to borrow money on the credit of the United States.''
The debt limit is the means by which Congress--Congress--exercises this critical legislative responsibility.
I can remember well that lesson, that lecture, if you will, from Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the institutional flame of the Senate, who would have repeated that Congress cannot give debt limit authority to the executive, should not, cannot. It is not constitutional.
To implement this congressional prerogative, the amount of money the Federal Government is allowed to borrow is subject to a specific statutory limit.
From time to time, Congress considers and adopts legislation to change this limit and has done so more than 100 times since the first modern debt limit was set way back in 1939, and we will do so again shortly. We have to.
So preserving this role and establishing the debt limit is vital to encourage deficit reduction and to uphold our constitutional tradition of legislative control over borrowing. Not only does the debt limit provide an essential check on executive borrowing, it provides public accountability--everybody is talking about transparency--for Congress's borrowing and debt management practices. We cannot duck that responsibility. We cannot pass this debt limit simply to the Executive and duck our responsibility and the public accountability.
In other words, debates over the debt limit, as difficult and as contentious as they are--and they are; I know that--shed the light of day on the overall financial condition of the Federal Government. Precluding these discussions by removing Congress's authority over the debt limit would lead to a less well-informed decisionmaking over fiscal policy. That is probably the understatement of my remarks. It is a nice way to put it.
We can do this. In the past, legislation to raise the debt limit has frequently been coupled with legislation to reduce the overall Federal debt and deficit. That is the way we should do it. These extensions, often approved on a bipartisan basis, have been important catalysts for fiscal reform. In this respect, the debt limit is a strong mechanism, a strong tool, a way for Congress to evaluate fiscal policy and to maintain control over such policy.
Abdicating this role would fundamentally alter the checks and balances embedded in the Constitution. This is a power that should not be bargained away.
The necessary and critical battle to control spending is far from over. I view the debt ceiling debate as a critical means in what has to be an ongoing effort to tighten the government's fiscal belt--if we can just do that. But we cannot settle our national finances by fundamentally altering the constitutional structure and processes governing those finances. We cannot cavalierly give up one of our most important tools in evaluating and reining in the Federal Government's runaway spending.
Equally clear, we cannot keep spending what we do not have. We must continue to fight for spending cuts, for debt reduction, and against tax increases and, I might add, the tidal wave of regulations that continue to pour out of Washington.
In response to calls to give up this vital congressional authority over debt issuance, I am submitting today a simple resolution. Let's put the Senate on record. The Congress holds the sole authority to borrow money on the credit of the United States and cannot cede this power to the President.
I invite everybody to cosponsor this important measure and look forward to passage of this resolution. This should be a bipartisan effort, and it is absolutely necessary.",KS,ROBERTS,0.674,R,mr presid rise submit resolut make absolut clear congress congress author respons set feder debt limit even submit resolut feel absolut necessari rais feder debt limitth limit place govern borrowinga everybodi know hot topic around washington key issu start 113th congress anoth case could maintain regular order regular author address problem best way us approach task get fiscal hous order know lot disput breach limit mean lot talk clear great deal public financi market extrem concern feder govern abil meet financi oblig hit limit presid ask larg increas debt ceil administr call limit other administr hous call congress give author set debt limitrath amazingthu give execut branch unilater author borrow good idea feder govern collect enough revenu pay spend oblig must borrow make shortfal everybodi know borrow 42 cent everi 1 oblig spend clearlyi think everybodi would agre either side aisl publican unsustain situat get wors begin meaning discuss spend prioriti includingincludingentitl spend strengthen preserv program futur gener nation debt grow everybodi seen chart 16 4 trillion total public debt outstand end third quarter pass 16 07 trillion 15 86 trillion report june 2012 wrong path feder debt equival least 73 percent nation gross domest productnearli doubl level percentag gdp back 1990 long ago accord measur 60percent increas debt limit sinc 2009 rate go short year spend pay interest debt discretionari program outsid defens even defens go difficult time sequest alreadi cut onehalf trillion dollar let say mean money educ mean money agricultur mean money environ mean money health care goe pay interest debt feder debt accumul borrow includ bill note bond issu depart treasuri current statutori debt limit 16 394 trillion establish januari 28 last year 2012about 1 year agound procedur budget control act 2011 accord depart treasuri decemb 31just last monthtot debt outstand subject limit 25 millionmillion use lot moneybelow current limit amount outstand debt reach debt limit govern longer issu addit debt cover cash shortfal need fund govern oper meet legal oblig similar power purs congresss power borrow firmli root constitut tradit founder understood potenti danger permit execut branch unilater incur new public debt articl constitut empow onlyonlycongress borrow money credit unit state debt limit mean congresscongressexercis critic legisl respons rememb well lesson lectur robert c byrd west virginia institut flame senat would repeat congress cannot give debt limit author execut cannot constitut implement congression prerog amount money feder govern allow borrow subject specif statutori limit time time congress consid adopt legisl chang limit done 100 time sinc first modern debt limit set way back 1939 shortli preserv role establish debt limit vital encourag deficit reduct uphold constitut tradit legisl control borrow debt limit provid essenti check execut borrow provid public accountabilityeverybodi talk transparencyfor congresss borrow debt manag practic cannot duck respons cannot pass debt limit simpli execut duck respons public account word debat debt limit difficult contenti areand know thatsh light day overal financi condit feder govern preclud discuss remov congresss author debt limit would lead less wellinform decisionmak fiscal polici probabl understat remark nice way put past legisl rais debt limit frequent coupl legisl reduc overal feder debt deficit way extens often approv bipartisan basi import catalyst fiscal reform respect debt limit strong mechan strong tool way congress evalu fiscal polici maintain control polici abdic role would fundament alter check balanc embed constitut power bargain away necessari critic battl control spend far view debt ceil debat critic mean ongo effort tighten govern fiscal beltif cannot settl nation financ fundament alter constitut structur process govern financ cannot cavalierli give one import tool evalu rein feder govern runaway spend equal clear cannot keep spend must continu fight spend cut debt reduct tax increas might add tidal wave regul continu pour washington respons call give vital congression author debt issuanc submit today simpl resolut let put senat record congress hold sole author borrow money credit unit state cannot cede power presid invit everybodi cosponsor import measur look forward passag resolut bipartisan effort absolut necessari

550,TX.POE,TX,Poe,"Mr. Speaker, I submit the following. Disease. Death. Bankruptcy. That's how the Panama Canal got started. At the time, the nineteenth century, trade and economic activity boomed in this part of the world and with it, other nations tried to cash in. As the U.S., Britain and France competed to assert their influence in the region, they ran into one problem: land. They didn't have a way to ship goods from the Atlantic to the Pacific without making the treacherous and lengthy journey around the tip of Cape Horn in South America. All three nations knew there was a need for a shorter sea lane connecting the two oceans. Unfortunately, the French got there first.
In 1881, the French sent veteran builder Ferdinand de Lesseps, who oversaw the successful construction of the Suez Canal in Egypt, to build a canal in Panama, then a province of Colombia. In the first nine years of construction, the French spent hundreds of millions of dollars, lost 20,000 workers to malaria and yellow fever and only completed eleven miles of the canal. The project went bankrupt and failed. The dream of a connection between east and west seemed all but dead . . . then came Teddy Roosevelt. The former Roughrider knew an opportunity when he saw one and seized upon it.
The U.S. was emerging as a world power and Roosevelt saw that having a shorter route to the Pacific and beyond was a way to expand American Naval Power and Economic opportunity. Such foresight proved correct in WWII. Roosevelt quickly got to work, having his Secretary of State, John Hay negotiate the Hay-Herran Treaty to purchase land in the Colombia province of Panama. The U.S. Senate ratified the treaty. But there was a big hiccup: the Colombians wanted more money and refused to approve the treaty.
Roosevelt wasn't about to be duped and pour more money in the project, perhaps ending up like the French. He knew that the Panamanians wanted the U.S. to complete the 51-mile canal and he knew that they wanted independence. (Some claim that Roosevelt took advantage of the unrest and stirred up Panama's revolution against the Colombians, but that's for historians to debate). The U.S. did not get involved in the fight, but helped the Panamanians by sending the gunboat, the U.S.S. Nashville, and ten other warships from both the Atlantic and Pacific to show support. This is now known as ``gunboat diplomacy''. Panama's non-violent coup-de-tat was successful, and the nation of Panama was born. With that, the U.S. and Panama ratified a treaty and construction of the canal began. One revolution, $700 million and ten years later the Panama Canal Zone--now U.S. Territory--was completed in 1914.
Fast forward 99 years. After President Carter returned the canal zone to Panama, it has since maintained control of the security and operation of the canal. Panama has undertaken a critically important expansion of the canal. One that will add a third channel and a new set of locks, allowing larger cargo ships to pass through. Approved in 2006, this new expansion--dubbed PanamEx--will finally completed next year. Surprisingly, no Panamanian chapter of the EPA held it up, and only a few environmental groups opposed. Perhaps it's a transportation miracle.
Of course, Panama benefits from this widening and deepening of the canal, but so will the United States. The recent implementation of the U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement approved by Congress, along with this $5.25 billion canal expansion project, ensures that free trade between the U.S. and Panama will continue to grow. And, because of our geographic location, this expansion will ``expand Texas' position as a global gateway for the nation,'' according to the Panama Canal Working Group. That means a huge increase in exports from the gulf coast and our Great State, including the Port of Houston, to countries around the world.
Trade in Texas and Houston drives our economy, and the engine for trade is ports. With that, we'll see more exports of dry and liquid bulk, agriculture products, coal, petrochemicals, military cargo, and consumer goods. Larger and wider vessels, like tankers carrying liquefied natural gas, will now be able to enjoy quick, reliable transit through the canal. That's good news for us here in Houston and good news for our State.
Next year, we celebrate 100 years since Roosevelt's dream became a reality. Thanks to Teddy's dream, the U.S. built the canal and our economy and security have benefitted from the opportunities that it created. God bless Teddy.

554,FL.CASTOR,FL,Castor,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and highlight the distinguished life of Bill McBride. Mr. McBride's contributions to the Tampa Bay community, the State of Florida, and the country are worthy of recognition by all.
Born on May 10, 1945, Mr. McBride moved to Florida at the age of 9 and spent most of his childhood in Leesburg, Florida where he attended high school and distinguished himself on the football field as a fullback and linebacker. While attending the University of Florida on a football scholarship, his football career was derailed by a knee injury. Mr. McBride then turned to public service, becoming an active member in Florida Blue Key honor society and president of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.
At the height of the Vietnam War, Mr. McBride dropped out of law school and enlisted in the U.S. Marines. He volunteered for combat duty, rose to the rank of captain, and was awarded a Bronze Star with a Combat V for valor for his wartime service. After returning from Vietnam, Mr. McBride finished law school. At that time, he became a civic leader in such organizations as the United Way and the Florida Holocaust Museum. He also became a managing partner of Holland and Knight, one of Florida's largest law firms.
Bill McBride was a force for good in the Tampa Bay community and a strong advocate for public education and civil rights in Florida. As a gubernatorial candidate in 2002, he championed smaller class sizes, greater support for teachers, and encouraged greater investment in education. Throughout his life he promoted equality in Florida as well, advocating for the survivors of the Rosewood racial massacre, pro bono legal work, and gay rights. His mission in life was to serve Florida, and he accomplished that in innumerable ways. His selfless dedication to our community and State will be greatly missed.
The Tampa Bay community is proud to recognize Bill McBride for his lifelong dedication to improving the lives of Floridians.

557,IL.QUIGLEY,IL,Quigley,"Mr. Speaker, last month the city of Chicago lost a legendary canoe-maker and conservationist. Ralph Frese, known as ``Mr. Canoe,'' got his first boat when he was just 14, and spent the next 50 years championing the conservation of Chicago-region rivers.
Starting in the 1960s, Ralph was active with the Clean Streams Committee, reporting waterway conditions, pollution and blockages to government agencies. In recognition of his efforts, he was inducted into the National Rivers Hall of Fame, and in 2007 a stretch of the Chicago River was renamed ``The Ralph Frese River Trail.''
Ralph is responsible for introducing thousands of people to the pleasures of paddling a canoe across Illinois' waterways and loved nothing more than sharing his knowledge with other would-be conservationists.
I once had the pleasure of canoeing down the Chicago River with Ralph and learned so much during our time together. More than anything, I left fully inspired by his love for the natural world around us, even in big cities like Chicago.

558,CA.HONDA,CA,Honda,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Nanotechnology Advancement and New Opportunities (NANO) Act.
The NANO Act is a comprehensive bill to promote the development and responsible stewardship of nanotechnology in the United States. The legislation draws upon the findings of the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Nanotechnology, which I convened. The Task Force included nanotechnology experts with backgrounds in established industry, startup companies, consulting groups, non-profits, academia, government, medical research, and venture capital from around my home State of California, which is a leader in the field of nanotechnology.
Nanotechnology has the potential to create entirely new industries and radically transform the basis of competition in other fields, and I am proud of my work with former Science Committee Chairman Sherry Boehlert on the Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 to foster research in this area.
But one of the things I have heard from experts in the field is that while the United States is a leader in nanotechnology research, our foreign competitors are focusing more resources and effort on the commercialization of those research results than we are.
In its report Thinking Big About Thinking Small, which can be found on my website, the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Nanotechnology made a series of recommendations for ways that the nation can promote the development and commercialization of nanotechnology. The NANO Act includes a number of these recommendations.
In addition, the bill addresses concerns that have been raised about whether the Federal Government is doing enough to address potential health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology. The NANO Act requires the development of a nanotechnology research strategy that establishes research priorities for the Federal Government and industry that will ensure the development and responsible stewardship of nanotechnology. This strategy will help to resolve the uncertainty that is one of the major obstacles to the commercialization of nanotechnology--uncertainty about what the risks might be and uncertainty about how the Federal Government might regulate nanotechnology in the future.
The NANO Act also includes a number of provisions to create partnerships, raise awareness, and implement strategic policies to resolve obstacles and promote nanotechnology. It will: create a public-private investment partnership to address the nanotechnology commercialization gap; establish a tax credit for investment in nanotechnology firms; authorize a grant program to support the establishment and development of nanotechnology incubators; establish a Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for ``nano-CAD'' tools; establish grant programs for nanotechnology research to address specific challenges in the areas of energy, environment, homeland security, and health; establish a tax credit for nanotechnology education and training program expenses; establish a grant program to support the development of curriculum materials for interdisciplinary nanotechnology courses at higher education institutions; direct NSF to establish a program to encourage manufacturing companies to enter into partnerships with occupational training centers for the development of training to support nanotechnology manufacturing; and call for the development of a strategy for increasing interaction on nanotechnology interests between DOE national labs and the informal science education community.
I look forward to working with Science, Space and Technology Committee Chairman Lamar Smith and Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson on this bill and their committee's other efforts to reauthorize the Nation's nanotechnology research and development program.",CA,HONDA,-0.528,D,mr speaker rise today introduc nanotechnolog advanc new opportun nano act nano act comprehens bill promot develop respons stewardship nanotechnolog unit state legisl draw upon find blue ribbon task forc nanotechnolog conven task forc includ nanotechnolog expert background establish industri startup compani consult group nonprofit academia govern medic research ventur capit around home state california leader field nanotechnolog nanotechnolog potenti creat entir new industri radic transform basi competit field proud work former scienc committe chairman sherri boehlert nanotechnolog research develop act 2003 foster research area one thing heard expert field unit state leader nanotechnolog research foreign competitor focus resourc effort commerci research result report think big think small found websit blue ribbon task forc nanotechnolog made seri recommend way nation promot develop commerci nanotechnolog nano act includ number recommend addit bill address concern rais whether feder govern enough address potenti health safeti risk associ nanotechnolog nano act requir develop nanotechnolog research strategi establish research prioriti feder govern industri ensur develop respons stewardship nanotechnolog strategi help resolv uncertainti one major obstacl commerci nanotechnologyuncertainti risk might uncertainti feder govern might regul nanotechnolog futur nano act also includ number provis creat partnership rais awar implement strateg polici resolv obstacl promot nanotechnolog creat publicpriv invest partnership address nanotechnolog commerci gap establish tax credit invest nanotechnolog firm author grant program support establish develop nanotechnolog incub establish nanoscal scienc engin center nanocad tool establish grant program nanotechnolog research address specif challeng area energi environ homeland secur health establish tax credit nanotechnolog educ train program expens establish grant program support develop curriculum materi interdisciplinari nanotechnolog cours higher educ institut direct nsf establish program encourag manufactur compani enter partnership occup train center develop train support nanotechnolog manufactur call develop strategi increas interact nanotechnolog interest doe nation lab inform scienc educ commun look forward work scienc space technolog committe chairman lamar smith rank member eddi bernic johnson bill committe effort reauthor nation nanotechnolog research develop program

561,NY.MAFFEI,NY,Maffei,"Mr. Speaker, I rise to extend my congratulations to the Village of Minoa on the occasion of its Centennial Celebration. I am honored to join the Central New York community in celebrating Minoa on this historic occasion.
The Village of Minoa's founding tells an interesting story about the character of the people who have lived there and about Central New York as a whole. In 1913, during the incorporation of the Village of Minoa, a group of Minoa women banded together in solidarity to vote for incorporation in the village election. Although national law prohibited these women from voting, village law afforded them the ability to do so in this local election. These united women were able to have their voices heard several years before the 19th amendment was passed. As a result of this group's support and solidarity, Minoa officially became incorporated on January 12, 1913. The Village of Minoa demonstrates how then and now, Central New Yorkers have unlimited potential when every person has a fair shot.
For 100 years, Minoa has served as a vital part of Onondaga County and Central New York. It was a prominent railroad community for many years and continues to be a wonderful place to live and raise a family.

562,AL.BONNER,AL,Bonner,"Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a beloved public servant who defined leadership in his community by reaching out to all points of view. I am speaking of Daphne, Alabama Mayor Bailey Yelding, who passed away on January 22, 2013, after a brief illness.
Born and raised in Daphne, Mayor Yelding loved his community so much that he never really left it. He was always proud of his home town, noting to the Mobile Press-Register, ``You live and work in a place where it's all been great for you, why not love it?''
And he gave back so much to the community he loved. After graduating from the Baldwin County Training School in Daphne in 1957, and receiving a degree from Alabama State University, he set his sights on helping young people in Daphne. He soon began a career in local education that would encompass 39 years of his life, changing lives and racking up an impressive record as both a football and basketball coach.
At Baldwin County Training School, Coach Yelding earned a 49-16-1 record at the helm of the school's football program. After he transitioned to Fairhope High School in 1970, he went on to become the first African American coach of an integrated high school team in Baldwin County. As head varsity basketball coach, he led the team to a 302-130 record.
After nearly four decades of educating the young people of Baldwin County, Coach Yelding then turned his attention to a different challenge--serving his community in elected office. In 2000 he ran for and was elected to the Daphne City Council. For the next 11 years, Councilman Yelding was a reliable voice for all the people of Daphne, reaching out to his fellow councilmen and the community to put the city first.
In 2011, the Daphne City Council appointed Yelding to serve the unexpired term of Mayor Fred Small who retired early from office. In 2012, Mayor Yelding ran for a full term on the platform of experience and stability. He survived a lively campaign and a runoff in October 2012 to become Daphne's first popularly elected African American mayor.
To everyone who knew him and worked with him, Mayor Yelding was more than the chief executive of the city. He was a pillar of integrity and a consensus builder. In short--a leader. It's not surprising that he was successful in public office. He took the skills he honed as a winning football and basketball coach to city hall, forging teamwork while motivating city employees and the community to greater heights.
Mayor Yelding will be remembered not only as a trail blazer, but also as a wise and steady hand at Daphne City Hall.
On behalf of the people of South Alabama, I wish to extend my condolences to Mayor Yelding's family, many friends and to the people of Daphne. You are all in our thoughts and prayers.

563,CT.COURTNEY,CT,Courtney,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor a fierce and passionate advocate for southeastern Connecticut, John Markowicz.
John was well known in southeastern Connecticut for the many hats he wore over the course of his life. Graduating the U.S. Naval Academy in 1965, John achieved the rank of captain in the Navy where he served in the submarine force in a variety of posts, including the USS Pargo (SSN 650) and USS Guitarro (SSN 665). Following active duty service, John continued in the Naval Reserve to achieve 34 years in the service of our Nation. In his life in the private sector, John helped found Sonalysts in 1976, a defense contractor in Waterford, Connecticut that is one of the region's largest employers today. Following his time at Sonalysts, John served in a number of positions to promote economic development in eastern Connecticut, most notably as Executive Director of the Connecticut Enterprise Region (seCTer).
As impressive as these achievements are, he is best and rightly remembered by the southeastern Connecticut region as the leader of the fight to save Naval Submarine Base New London from closure during the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process.
When the submarine base was placed on the BRAC list in 2005, John activated a non-partisan and diverse group of experts tasked with the seemingly insurmountable challenge of overturning the Pentagon's recommendation. John and his team burrowed into the data, found critical flaws, and constructed the airtight argument against closing this unique and irreplaceable naval asset.
Although I was not in Congress at the time, I vividly remember attending the Boston regional meeting of the BRAC commission in the summer of 2005. With John and his case at the lead, Connecticut's delegation picked apart the misguided decision to close the base--stressing the economic harm, the strategic impact and, most importantly, the various flaws underpinning the case to close the base.
It worked. In September 2005 the base was removed from the list and spared closure. While there were many involved in the successful effort to save the base, it was John's leadership, attention to detail, and unsparing devotion to the mission that was rightly credited with making it possible.
As importantly, John understood that the work of promoting and defending the base did not end with the decision to remove the base from the BRAC list. In the years following, John stressed the need for the creation of a state Office of Military Affairs and a historic new partnership between Connecticut and the Navy to invest in the infrastructure of the base--both of which are in place now and under way. He also worked closely with my staff and me in monitoring the latest rumors about new BRACs and following Congressional debates about submarine production like a box score.
In my years of knowing him, I always found John to be a quiet but effective professional. He never pursued the spotlight, never wanted the glory--he sought only to accomplish the mission. In his passing, eastern Connecticut has lost a fierce advocate for the ``Submarine Capitol of the World'' and all of us will long remember all he gave to our region and our state. His memory will live on in the thousands of people at work every day at a more modem submarine base that he helped to save--and the countless businesses and employees across the region that rely on it.

564,IA.LATHAM,IA,Latham,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Alex Barrett of Boy Scout Troop 188 in Ankeny, Iowa for achieving the rank of Eagle Scout.
The Eagle Scout rank is the highest advancement rank in scouting. Only about five percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout Award. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards that have been well-maintained over the past century.
To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass specific tests that are organized by requirements and merit badges, as well as completing an Eagle Project to benefit the community. For his project, Alex constructed and installed duck nesting platforms at the Chichaqua Bottoms Greenbelt in Polk County. The work ethic Alex has shown in his Eagle Project and every other project leading up to his Eagle Scout rank speaks volumes of his commitment to serving a cause greater than himself and assisting his community.
Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication and perseverance. I am honored to represent Alex and his family in the United States Congress. I know that all of my colleagues in the House will join me in congratulating him on obtaining the Eagle Scout ranking, and I wish him continued success in his future education and career.",IA,LATHAM,0.491,R,mr speaker rise today recogn congratul alex barrett boy scout troop 188 ankeni iowa achiev rank eagl scout eagl scout rank highest advanc rank scout five percent boy scout earn eagl scout award award performancebas achiev high standard wellmaintain past centuri earn eagl scout rank boy scout oblig pass specif test organ requir merit badg well complet eagl project benefit commun project alex construct instal duck nest platform chichaqua bottom greenbelt polk counti work ethic alex shown eagl project everi project lead eagl scout rank speak volum commit serv caus greater assist commun mr speaker exampl set young man support famili demonstr reward hard work dedic persever honor repres alex famili unit state congress know colleagu hous join congratul obtain eagl scout rank wish continu success futur educ career
565,KY.BARR,KY,Barr,"Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise today to recognize my friends and members of the Kentucky Right to Life Association, who in 2013 will celebrate 40 years of nobly and steadfastly defending the rights of all human life, born and unborn, young and old, regardless of ability or disability.
The Kentucky Right to Life Association came together 40 years ago in response to the 1973 Roe vs. Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision which disregarded the ethical traditions of countless Americans by superseding the traditional prerogative of states and local communities to protect life. Today, the Kentucky Right to Life Association is comprised of thousands of individuals working together to restore the law to protect the lives of the unborn and the most vulnerable among us, and to uphold the belief that every human being has a right to live--a belief that I strongly share. Right to Life is comprised of individuals of different faiths, political beliefs, and backgrounds, all united in one purpose. Their special union sets a strong example of organizational leadership for other movements and causes of moral consequence.
Today, I congratulate my friends with the Kentucky Right to Life Association for their 40 years of leadership on this, the most consequential moral issue of our time. I also would like to personally welcome those members joining me in Washington, DC this Friday, January 25, 2013, to participate in the annual March for Life on the National Mall.

566,AL.SEWELL,AL,Sewell,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to the life and legacy of Dr. James Hood, one of the first African-Americans to attend The University of Alabama, who passed away Thursday, January 17 at the age of 70. Dr. Hood was a trailblazer in the quest for civil rights and equality. I am deeply saddened by his passing but I am comforted in knowing that his legacy will live on.
Dr. Hood was born on November 10, 1942 in Gadsden, Alabama. He attended Gadsden public schools and he enrolled at the University of Alabama in 1963.
On June 11, 1963, Dr. Hood along with fellow student Vivian Malone attempted to enroll at the University of Alabama. Upon his arrival to the Tuscaloosa campus, then Alabama Governor George Wallace physically blocked Dr. Hood from entering Foster Auditorium to register for classes. As the world watched, Gov. Wallace's efforts to block Dr. Hood and Ms. Malone were recorded in our Nation's history as ``The Stand in the Schoolhouse Door.'' Later that day, Dr. Hood, with the support of a federal court order and members of the Alabama National Guard, was eventually allowed to register for classes and pursue his degree.
However, despite his bravery and courage, Dr. Hood's time as a student at the University of Alabama was short. On August 11, 1963, Dr. Hood left the University after numerous threats and constant harassment. He would later return to the University of Alabama in 1997 to obtain a doctorate in interdisciplinary studies.
After his short time at the University of Alabama, Dr. Hood went on to obtain a bachelor's degree from Wayne State University and a master's degree from Michigan State. Dr. Hood also studied at the University of London. He later served as deputy police chief in Detroit and as a chairman of the police science program at the Madison Area Technical College in Wisconsin before retiring in 2002. During his extraordinary life, Dr. Hood was also a devoted father to five children and nine grandchildren.
Today, as we mourn the passing of this American hero, we are reminded of his sacrifices for our Nation. Dr. Hood's courage was a testament to his commitment to education and equality. On behalf of a grateful Nation, we honor Dr. Hood's personal sacrifices and commit to sharing his story with future generations.
Today, ``The Stand in the Schoolhouse Door'' is remembered as a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement. Dr. Hood's quest for educational equality served as a catalyst for the opportunities that many of us enjoy today. As a benefactor of Dr. Hood's contributions, I am humbled by this opportunity to further solidify his place in American history. As the first African-American woman elected to Congress from the state of Alabama, I know that my journey would not be possible without the contributions of foot soldiers like Dr. Hood. Let his life serve as a testament to the courage and strength of one individual's ability to change the trajectory of our Nation. On behalf of the 7th Congressional District, the State of Alabama and this Nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and legacy of Dr. James Hood.",AL,SEWELL,-0.319,D,mr speaker rise today recogn pay tribut life legaci dr jame hood one first africanamerican attend univers alabama pass away thursday januari 17 age 70 dr hood trailblaz quest civil right equal deepli sadden pass comfort know legaci live dr hood born novemb 10 1942 gadsden alabama attend gadsden public school enrol univers alabama 1963 june 11 1963 dr hood along fellow student vivian malon attempt enrol univers alabama upon arriv tuscaloosa campu alabama governor georg wallac physic block dr hood enter foster auditorium regist class world watch gov wallac effort block dr hood ms malon record nation histori stand schoolhous door later day dr hood support feder court order member alabama nation guard eventu allow regist class pursu degre howev despit braveri courag dr hood time student univers alabama short august 11 1963 dr hood left univers numer threat constant harass would later return univers alabama 1997 obtain doctor interdisciplinari studi short time univers alabama dr hood went obtain bachelor degre wayn state univers master degre michigan state dr hood also studi univers london later serv deputi polic chief detroit chairman polic scienc program madison area technic colleg wisconsin retir 2002 extraordinari life dr hood also devot father five children nine grandchildren today mourn pass american hero remind sacrific nation dr hood courag testament commit educ equal behalf grate nation honor dr hood person sacrific commit share stori futur gener today stand schoolhous door rememb pivot moment civil right movement dr hood quest educ equal serv catalyst opportun mani us enjoy today benefactor dr hood contribut humbl opportun solidifi place american histori first africanamerican woman elect congress state alabama know journey would possibl without contribut foot soldier like dr hood let life serv testament courag strength one individu abil chang trajectori nation behalf 7th congression district state alabama nation ask colleagu join honor life legaci dr jame hood
567,FL.GRAYSON,FL,Grayson,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Pura Delgado Andino, a shining example of leadership and inspiration to us all. Mrs. Delgado's distinguished career in community advocacy deserves our acknowledgement.
Mrs. Delgado was born in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico on February 2, 1931. At age sixteen, she moved from Puerto Rico to New York. There Mrs. Delgado met her late husband, Jose Caraballo, and became a mother to two wonderful children.
In 1967, Mrs. Delgado moved to Connecticut, where her lasting commitment to civic engagement and community participation began. Mrs. Delgado was instrumental in the creation of the Hill Health Center for Children and Youth at Yale University. Recognizing the need for a youth-oriented and minority-focused health care center, Mrs. Delgado obtained a grant to better serve these children and her community. Because of her leadership on this issue, Mrs. Delgado served as Health Education Assistant to the Center's Director.
Working alongside the Dean of the Yale School of Medicine, Mrs. Delgado helped guide the school's implementation of its affirmative action program. At the time, affirmative action policies were often limited to African American students, but Mrs. Delgado encouraged the school to extend their efforts to other minority communities, such as Puerto Ricans and Mexicans. Thanks to Mrs. Delgado's involvement, the school graduated twenty-five minority students. One of these students who went on to serve his community is the Honorable Judge Wilfredo Martinez of Orlando, Florida.
Drawing again on her intimate knowledge of the community and innate ability to express its needs, Mrs. Delgado obtained another grant to begin operation of the Fair Haven Health Clinic. This clinic recently celebrated its forty-third anniversary.
Though Mrs. Delgado retired at age seventy-two, her record of accomplishments in the physical and mental health areas remains impressive. She has served on a variety of public service and community advisory boards, including on the Board for Progressive Action, which aimed to empower low-income communities through education, counseling, and occupational training.
In 1991 Mrs. Delgado relocated to Irma Shores Lake in Orlando, Florida, where she began several small businesses and became an active member of the community. Mrs. Delgado served as a Regional Field Operator for President Bill Clinton in 1996 and helped coin the term ``I-4 Corridor''.
Mrs. Delgado is a proud member of the Asociacion Borinquena de la Florida Central and currently serves as Vice Chair for the Black-Latino and Puerto Rican Alliance for Justice of Florida.

569,FL.MURPHY,FL,Murphy,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Navy SEAL Aaron Vaughn, whose memory was recently honored by a monument being dedicated in tribute to his service and sacrifice at the Sailfish Splash Water Park in Stuart, Florida.
It is most appropriate that the memorial is located at the Sailfish Splash Water Park. As Aaron's mother, Karen Vaughn, described at the memorial service, it is ``most fitting since inside those gates there will always be living, breathing representations of the things Aaron held most dear--love, laughter, family, friends and fun.''
Aaron Vaughn grew up in Florida's 18th Congressional district, where he attended Martin County High School and was a member of the football team. Aaron then received his Associate's Degree from Indian River State College, studying turf grass science. Aaron later enlisted in the Navy and became a member of the elite Navy SEALs.
Aaron bravely served as a Navy SEAL, a lifelong dream of his. Aaron's father, Billy Vaughn, said that ``the commander of SEAL Team Six said he was a fearless leader who was headed to the top.'' In August 2011, Aaron lost his life when his helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan.
Mr. Speaker, Aaron Vaughn dedicated his life to this country and I am proud that the city of Stuart has recognized his service by dedicating this memorial in his honor.

570,GA.LEWIS,GA,Lewis,"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reintroduce the Voter Empowerment Act.
I am proud to be joined by my friends and colleagues--the Gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the Gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brady), the Gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), and over 160 of our Democratic colleagues in sponsoring this landmark legislation. Our good friend, Senator Gillibrand, is also introducing the companion to the Voter Empowerment Act in the Senate.
Today, January 23rd marks the 49th anniversary of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. This is the amendment which ended poll taxes, a tool used to undermine the right to vote for millions of African Americans. On this day, we must recommit ourselves in mind, body, and spirit to fight both overt and covert impediments to the most powerful non-violent tool we have in a democratic society.
The right to vote is precious, almost sacred, yet millions of Americans are still not registered to vote. How can we continue to be global leaders in promoting democratic values and principles, when so many citizens still face barriers to participating in an electoral democracy?
When my colleagues and I introduced this legislation last year, we urged prompt action to ensure access, accountability, and integrity in our nation's electoral system. Last November, we all watched aghast as Americans stood in line for hours on end determined to cast their vote. Some were able to weather the difficulties, while others were forced to give up. Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable. Earlier this week, the President stated in his inaugural address that, ``Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.''
The Voter Empowerment Act responds to that call to action with a plan. H.R. 12 modernizes the voter registration system in this nation. It helps voters with disabilities, members of the military and young people to fully access their right to vote and to have their vote counted.
The VEA also restores the integrity of the voting system, by providing well-informed, well-trained poll workers who know the law, and ensuring that election officials don't have a vested interest in the outcome of political campaigns. This bill protects voters from deceptive practices and intimidation and prohibits voter caging, and will ensure that every vote is counted. H.R. 12 creates a national hotline so that problems are reported, corrected and prevented in real time, and it reauthorizes the Election Assistance Commission, the only agency with election administration expertise, to ensure the highest standards are being met nationwide.
People sacrificed their lives for this precious right. We have a duty to honor this legacy and the lives that were lost by ensuring this sacred right. We must all come together to guarantee open, fair, free access to democracy in our great country. I hope that each and every one of my colleagues will join me in support of this landmark legislation.",GA,LEWIS,-0.535,D,mr speaker rise today reintroduc voter empower act proud join friend colleaguesth gentleman south carolina mr clyburn gentleman maryland mr hoyer gentleman pennsylvania mr bradi gentleman michigan mr conyer 160 democrat colleagu sponsor landmark legisl good friend senat gillibrand also introduc companion voter empower act senat today januari 23rd mark 49th anniversari 24th amend u constitut amend end poll tax tool use undermin right vote million african american day must recommit mind bodi spirit fight overt covert impedi power nonviol tool democrat societi right vote preciou almost sacr yet million american still regist vote continu global leader promot democrat valu principl mani citizen still face barrier particip elector democraci colleagu introduc legisl last year urg prompt action ensur access account integr nation elector system last novemb watch aghast american stood line hour end determin cast vote abl weather difficulti other forc give mr speaker unaccept earlier week presid state inaugur address journey complet citizen forc wait hour exercis right vote voter empower act respond call action plan h r 12 modern voter registr system nation help voter disabl member militari young peopl fulli access right vote vote count vea also restor integr vote system provid wellinform welltrain poll worker know law ensur elect offici dont vest interest outcom polit campaign bill protect voter decept practic intimid prohibit voter cage ensur everi vote count h r 12 creat nation hotlin problem report correct prevent real time reauthor elect assist commiss agenc elect administr expertis ensur highest standard met nationwid peopl sacrif live preciou right duti honor legaci live lost ensur sacr right must come togeth guarante open fair free access democraci great countri hope everi one colleagu join support landmark legisl
571,VA.SCOTT,VA,Scott,"Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Center to Advance, Monitor and Preserve University Security (``CAMPUS'') Safety Act of 2013. The CAMPUS Safety Act previously passed the House of Representatives by voice vote as a standalone bill in the 110th and 111th Congresses and was included in the House-passed versions of the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2008 in the 110th Congress and the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2012 in the 112th Congress. It is my hope that the CAMPUS Safety Act will be signed into law during the 113th Congress. 
The purpose of the legislation is to enable our institutions of higher education to more easily obtain the best information available on how to keep our campuses safe and how to respond in the event of a campus emergency. The bill creates a National Center for Campus Public Safety (``Center''), which will be administered through the Department of Justice. The Center is designed to train campus public safety agencies in state of the art practices to assure campus safety, encourage research to strengthen college safety and security, and serve as a clearinghouse for the dissemination of relevant campus public safety information. The Director of the Center will have authority to award grants to institutions of higher learning to help them meet their enhanced public safety goals.
Over the past few years we have seen numerous tragedies occur at colleges and universities, including the disastrous events that occurred at Virginia Tech, Northern Illinois University and more recently at Old Dominion University that took the life of Congressman Elijah Cummings' nephew. Unfortunately, these events were the first of their kind at their schools and there was insufficient knowledge on how to prevent the tragedies or how to most effectively respond in their aftermath. While there is growing awareness that such threats are possible anywhere, many schools still have not developed safety protocols that would prepare them to maximize the prospects of preventing such tragedies or to effectively respond to them should they occur despite sound prevention efforts.
Our nation's colleges and universities play a large role in the development of our next generation of leaders and we should assist them in their efforts to keep our campuses and our students safe. The Clery Act already requires schools to have safety plans in order to participate in the Title IV deferral student aid programs; unfortunately there is no one place for schools to obtain reliable and useful information. It makes little sense to require the thousands of institutions of higher education to start from scratch and individually go through the cost and effort to develop comprehensive plans. Instead, they ought to be able to obtain guidance and assistance, including best practices, from a ``one stop shop'' like the Center.
The CAMPUS Safety Act will help institutions of higher learning understand how to prevent such tragedies from occurring, and how to respond immediately and effectively in case they do. Although this bill was originally drafted in direct response to the Virginia Tech shootings to specifically assist college and university campuses, I should note that in the wake of the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, public elementary and secondary schools and their governing agencies will be able to access the informational and training benefits of the Center.
I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this important legislation to ensure that our institutions of higher education have access to the information necessary to keep their schools safe.",VA,SCOTT,-0.39,D,mr speaker today introduc center advanc monitor preserv univers secur campu safeti act 2013 campu safeti act previous pass hous repres voic vote standalon bill 110th 111th congress includ housepass version colleg opportun afford act 2008 110th congress violenc women reauthor act 2012 112th congress hope campu safeti act sign law 113th congress purpos legisl enabl institut higher educ easili obtain best inform avail keep campus safe respond event campu emerg bill creat nation center campu public safeti center administ depart justic center design train campu public safeti agenc state art practic assur campu safeti encourag research strengthen colleg safeti secur serv clearinghous dissemin relev campu public safeti inform director center author award grant institut higher learn help meet enhanc public safeti goal past year seen numer tragedi occur colleg univers includ disastr event occur virginia tech northern illinoi univers recent old dominion univers took life congressman elijah cum nephew unfortun event first kind school insuffici knowledg prevent tragedi effect respond aftermath grow awar threat possibl anywher mani school still develop safeti protocol would prepar maxim prospect prevent tragedi effect respond occur despit sound prevent effort nation colleg univers play larg role develop next gener leader assist effort keep campus student safe cleri act alreadi requir school safeti plan order particip titl iv deferr student aid program unfortun one place school obtain reliabl use inform make littl sens requir thousand institut higher educ start scratch individu go cost effort develop comprehens plan instead ought abl obtain guidanc assist includ best practic one stop shop like center campu safeti act help institut higher learn understand prevent tragedi occur respond immedi effect case although bill origin draft direct respons virginia tech shoot specif assist colleg univers campus note wake tragedi sandi hook elementari school newtown connecticut public elementari secondari school govern agenc abl access inform train benefit center urg colleagu cosponsor support import legisl ensur institut higher educ access inform necessari keep school safe

Mr. Uggiano served the Council for the period July 2010-June 2012, and he is being honored by the Knights of Columbus as part of the 115th anniversary celebration.
William Uggiano previously served his country with distinction during a long career in the Navy, which included tours of duty on four different warships, the last of which was the USS Guam. He was even baptized at sea on the Guam off the coast of Liberia. He retired in 1999 and enrolled in Luzerne Community College where he received an Associates degree in computer information systems.
